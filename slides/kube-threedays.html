- Welcome to the New Relic Kubernetes training by Ardan Labs on Aug 20-22, 2019!

- Format is a general lecture and example labs with lunch, morning and afternoon breaks.

- Full screen container pictures indicate a good time for breaks.

- With a large class, consider your fellow classmates as you consider questions. We have a LOT of material to cover!

## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials
  
- Credit is also due to [multiple contributors](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/graphs/contributors) — thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) ...

- ... And looking for answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes) and other outlets

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster

# Pre-requirements

- Be comfortable with the UNIX command line

  - navigating directories

  - editing files

  - a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

- Some Docker knowledge

  - `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`

  - ideally, you know how to write a Dockerfile and build it
    <br/>
    (even if it's a `FROM` line and a couple of `RUN` commands)

- It's totally OK if you are not a Docker expert!

- We are going to build, ship, and run containers!

- You are invited to reproduce all the demos

- All hands-on sections are clearly identified, like the gray rectangle below

## You get a cluster of cloud VMs

- Each person gets a private cluster of cloud VMs (not shared with anybody else)

- They'll remain up for the duration of the workshop

- You should have a little card with login+password+IP addresses

- You can automatically SSH from one VM to another

- The nodes have aliases: `node1`, `node2`, etc.

  (32 bits CPU or OS... Laptops without administrator access... etc.)

- *"The whole team downloaded all these container images from the WiFi!
  <br/>... and it went great!"* (Literally no-one ever)

- All you need is a computer (or even a phone or tablet!), with:

  - an internet connection

  - a web browser

  - an SSH client

## SSH clients

- On Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set

- On Windows, get one of these:

  - [putty](http://www.putty.org/)
  - Microsoft [Win32 OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH)
  - [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
  - [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- On Android, [JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com/)
  ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh))
  works pretty well

- Nice-to-have: [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of SSH, if your internet connection tends to lose packets

class: self-paced, extra-details

## What is this Mosh thing?

*You don't have to use Mosh or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
We're just telling you about it because some of us think it's cool!*

- Mosh is "the mobile shell"

- It is essentially SSH over UDP, with roaming features

- It retransmits packets quickly, so it works great even on lossy connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It has intelligent local echo, so it works great even in high-latency connections

  (Like hotel or conference WiFi)

- It supports transparent roaming when your client IP address changes

  (Like when you hop from hotel to conference WiFi)

---

class: self-paced, extra-details

## Using Mosh

- To install it: `(apt|yum|brew) install mosh`

- It has been pre-installed on the VMs that we are using

- To connect to a remote machine: `mosh user@host`

  (It is going to establish an SSH connection, then hand off to UDP)

- It requires UDP ports to be open

  (By default, it uses a UDP port between 60000 and 61000)

## Connecting to our lab environment

.exercise[

- Log into the first VM (`node1`) with your SSH client

<!--
```bash
for N in $(awk '/\Wnode/{print $2}' /etc/hosts); do
  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $N true
done
```

```bash
### FIXME find a way to reset the cluster, maybe?
```
-->

- Check that you can SSH (without password) to `node2`:
  ```bash
  ssh node2
  ```
- Type `exit` or `^D` to come back to `node1`

<!-- ```bash exit``` -->

]

If anything goes wrong — ask for help!

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Doing or re-doing the workshop on your own?

- Use something like
  [Play-With-Docker](http://play-with-docker.com/) or
  [Play-With-Kubernetes](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com/)
  
  - Zero setup effort; but environment are short-lived and
  might have limited resources

- Create your own cluster (local or cloud VMs) such as with [Docker Desktop](https://blog.docker.com/2018/07/kubernetes-is-now-available-in-docker-desktop-stable-channel/)

  - Small setup effort; small cost; flexible environments

- Create a bunch of clusters for you and your friends using the tools we use
    ([instructions](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/prepare-vms))
  - Bigger setup effort; ideal for group training

class: self-paced

## Get your own Docker nodes

- If you already have some Docker nodes: great!

- If not: let's get some thanks to Play-With-Docker

.exercise[

- Go to http://www.play-with-docker.com/

- Log in

- Create your first node

<!-- ```open http://www.play-with-docker.com/``` -->

]

You will need a Docker ID to use Play-With-Docker.

(Creating a Docker ID is free.)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## We will (mostly) interact with node1 only

*These remarks apply only when using multiple nodes, of course.*

- Unless instructed, **all commands must be run from the first VM, `node1`**

- We will only check out/copy the code on `node1`

- During normal operations, we do not need access to the other nodes

- If we had to troubleshoot issues, we would use a combination of:

  - SSH (to access system logs, daemon status...)

  - Docker API (to check running containers and container engine status)

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Terminals

Once in a while, the instructions will say:
<br/>"Open a new terminal."

There are multiple ways to do this:

- create a new windows or **window tabs** on your machine, and SSH into the VM each time;

- use `screen` or `tmux` in a single window/tab from the target VM and open additional new windows from there.

You are welcome to use the method that you feel the most comfortable with.

.debug[[shared/connecting.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/connecting.md)]
---

## Tmux cheatsheet

[Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a terminal multiplexer like `screen`. It's great if you have UNIX superpowers!

Key feature: The equivalent of "window tabs" over SSH.

*You don't have to use it or even know about it to follow along.
<br/>
But some of us like to use it to switch between terminals.
<br/>
It has been preinstalled on your workshop nodes.*

- Ctrl-b c → creates a new window
- Ctrl-b n → go to next window
- Ctrl-b p → go to previous window
- Ctrl-b " → split window top/bottom
- Ctrl-b % → split window left/right
- Ctrl-b Alt-1 → rearrange windows in columns
- Ctrl-b Alt-2 → rearrange windows in rows
- Ctrl-b arrows → navigate to other windows
- Ctrl-b d → detach session
- tmux attach → reattach to session

## Kubernetes and Docker compatibility

- Kubernetes 1.15 validates Docker Engine versions [up to 18.09](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.15.md#dependencies)
  <br/>
  (the latest version when Kubernetes 1.14 was released)

- Kubernetes 1.13 only validates Docker Engine versions [up to 18.06](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md#external-dependencies)

- Is it a problem if I use Kubernetes with a "too recent" Docker Engine?

--

class: extra-details

- No!

- "Validates" = continuous integration builds with very extensive (and expensive) testing

- The Docker API is versioned, and offers strong backward-compatibility

  (If a client uses e.g. API v1.25, the Docker Engine will keep behaving the same way)

# Our sample application

- The repository also contains scripts and tools that we will use through the workshop

.exercise[

<!--
```bash
cd ~
if [ -d container.training ]; then
  mv container.training container.training.$RANDOM
fi
```
-->

- Clone the repository on `node1`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

]

(You can also fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork if you prefer that.)

## Downloading and running the application

Let's start this before we look around, as downloading will take a little time...

.exercise[

- Go to the `dockercoins` directory, in the cloned repo:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/dockercoins
  ```

- Without Kubernetes, use Docker Compose to build and run all containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

<!--
```longwait units of work done```
-->

]

Compose tells Docker to build all container images (pulling
the corresponding base images), then starts all containers,
and displays aggregated logs.

---

## What's this application?

--

- It is a DockerCoin miner! .emoji[💰🐳📦🚢]

--

- No, you can't buy coffee with DockerCoins

--

- How DockerCoins works:

  - generate a few random bytes

  - hash these bytes

  - increment a counter (to keep track of speed)

  - repeat forever!

--

- DockerCoins is *not* a cryptocurrency

  (the only common points are "randomness," "hashing," and "coins" in the name)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## DockerCoins in the microservices era

- DockerCoins is made of 5 services:

  - `rng` = "Random Number Generator": web service generating random bytes

  - `hasher` = web service computing hash of POSTed data

  - `worker` = background process calling `rng` and `hasher`

  - `webui` = web interface to watch progress

  - `redis` = data store (holds a counter updated by `worker`)

- These 5 services are visible in the application's Compose file,
  [docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml)

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## How DockerCoins works

- `worker` invokes web service `rng` to generate random bytes

- `worker` invokes web service `hasher` to hash these bytes

- `worker` does this in an infinite loop

- every second, `worker` updates `redis` to indicate how many loops were done

- `webui` queries `redis`, and computes and exposes "hashing speed" in our browser

*(See diagram on next slide!)*

---

## Service discovery between containers

How does each service find out the address of the other ones?

--

- We do not hard-code IP addresses in the code

- We do not hard-code FQDNs in the code, either

- We just connect to a service name, and container-magic does the rest

  (And by container-magic, we mean "a crafty, dynamic, embedded DNS server")

- True for both Docker Compose and Kubernetes

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]

## Example in `worker/worker.py`

```python
redis = Redis("`redis`")


def get_random_bytes():
    r = requests.get("http://`rng`/32")

## Links, naming, and service discovery

- Containers can have network aliases (resolvable through DNS)

- Compose file version 2+ makes each container reachable through its service name

- Compose file version 1 required "links" sections to accomplish this

- Network aliases are automatically namespaced

  - you can have multiple apps declaring and using a service named `database`

  - containers in the blue app will resolve `database` to the IP of the blue database

  - containers in the green app will resolve `database` to the IP of the green database

## Show me the code!

- You can check the GitHub repository with all the materials of this workshop:
  <br/>https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training

- The application is in the [dockercoins](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/tree/master/dockercoins)
  subdirectory

- The Compose file ([docker-compose.yml](
  https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/docker-compose.yml))
  lists all 5 services

- `redis` is using an official image from the Docker Hub

- `hasher`, `rng`, `worker`, `webui` are each built from a Dockerfile

- Each service's Dockerfile and source code is in its own directory

  (`hasher` is in the [hasher](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/) directory,
  `rng` is in the [rng](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/)
  directory, etc.)

## Compose file format version

*This is relevant only if you have used Compose before 2016...*

- Compose 1.6 introduced support for a new Compose file format (aka "v2")

- Services are no longer at the top level, but under a `services` section

- There has to be a `version` key at the top level, with value `"2"` (as a string, not an integer)

- Containers are placed on a dedicated network, making links unnecessary

- There are other minor differences, but upgrade is easy and straightforward

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

## Our application at work

- On the left-hand side, the "rainbow strip" shows the container names

- On the right-hand side, we see the output of our containers

- We can see the `worker` service making requests to `rng` and `hasher`

- For `rng` and `hasher`, we see HTTP access logs

## Connecting to the web UI

- "Logs are exciting and fun!" (No-one, ever)

- The `webui` container exposes a web dashboard; let's view it

.exercise[

- With a web browser, connect to `node1` on port 8000

- Remember: the `nodeX` aliases are valid only on the nodes themselves

- In your browser, you need to enter the IP address of your node

<!-- ```open http://node1:8000``` -->

]

A drawing area should show up, and after a few seconds, a blue
graph will appear.

---

class: self-paced, extra-details

## If the graph doesn't load

If you just see a `Page not found` error, it might be because your
Docker Engine is running on a different machine. This can be the case if:

- you are using the Docker Toolbox

- you are using a VM (local or remote) created with Docker Machine

- you are controlling a remote Docker Engine

When you run DockerCoins in development mode, the web UI static files
are mapped to the container using a volume. Alas, volumes can only
work on a local environment, or when using Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows.

How to fix this?

Stop the app with `^C`, edit `dockercoins.yml`, comment out the `volumes` section, and try again.

## Why does the speed seem irregular?

- It *looks like* the speed is approximately 4 hashes/second

- Or more precisely: 4 hashes/second, with regular dips down to zero

- Why?

--

class: extra-details

- The app actually has a constant, steady speed: 3.33 hashes/second
  <br/>
  (which corresponds to 1 hash every 0.3 seconds, for *reasons*)

- Yes, and?

.debug[[shared/sampleapp.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/sampleapp.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The reason why this graph is *not awesome*

- The worker doesn't update the counter after every loop, but up to once per second

- The speed is computed by the browser, checking the counter about once per second

- Between two consecutive updates, the counter will increase either by 4, or by 0

- The perceived speed will therefore be 4 - 4 - 4 - 0 - 4 - 4 - 0 etc.

- What can we conclude from this?

---

## Stopping the application

- If we interrupt Compose (with `^C`), it will politely ask the Docker Engine to stop the app

- The Docker Engine will send a `TERM` signal to the containers

- If the containers do not exit in a timely manner, the Engine sends a `KILL` signal

.exercise[

- Stop the application by hitting `^C`

<!--
```keys ^C```
-->

]

--

Some containers exit immediately, others take longer.

The containers that do not handle `SIGTERM` end up being killed after a 10s timeout. If we are very impatient, we can hit `^C` a second time!

# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `atseashop/api:v1.3`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `atseashop/webfront:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `atseashop/webfront:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Basic autoscaling

- Blue/green deployment, canary deployment

- Long running services, but also batch (one-off) jobs

- Overcommit our cluster and *evict* low-priority jobs

- Run services with *stateful* data (databases etc.)

- Fine-grained access control defining *what* can be done by *whom* on *which* resources

- Integrating third party services (*service catalog*)

- Automating complex tasks (*operators*)

## Kubernetes architecture: the nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker)

  - kubelet (the "node agent")

  - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)

- Nodes were formerly called "minions"

  (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)

## Kubernetes architecture: the control plane

- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)

  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager

  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster

- The control plane is also called the "master"

class: extra-details

## Running the control plane on special nodes

- It is common to reserve a dedicated node for the control plane

  (Except for single-node development clusters, like when using minikube)

- This node is then called a "master"

  (Yes, this is ambiguous: is the "master" a node, or the whole control plane?)

- Normal applications are restricted from running on this node

  (By using a mechanism called ["taints"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/))

- When high availability is required, each service of the control plane must be resilient

- The control plane is then replicated on multiple nodes

  (This is sometimes called a "multi-master" setup)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Running the control plane outside containers

- The services of the control plane can run in or out of containers

- For instance: since `etcd` is a critical service, some people
  deploy it directly on a dedicated cluster (without containers)

  (This is illustrated on the first "super complicated" schema)

- In some hosted Kubernetes offerings (e.g. AKS, GKE, EKS), the control plane is invisible

  (We only "see" a Kubernetes API endpoint)

- In that case, there is no "master node"

*For this reason, it is more accurate to say "control plane" rather than "master."*

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

No!

--

- By default, Kubernetes uses the Docker Engine to run containers

- We could also use `rkt` ("Rocket") from CoreOS

- Or leverage other pluggable runtimes through the *Container Runtime Interface*

  (like CRI-O, or containerd)

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

Yes!

--

- In this workshop, we run our app on a single node first

- We will need to build images and ship them around

- We can do these things without Docker
  <br/>
  (and get diagnosed with NIH¹ syndrome)

- Docker is still the most stable container engine today
  <br/>
  (but other options are maturing very quickly)

## Interacting with Kubernetes

- We will interact with our Kubernetes cluster through the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API is (mostly) RESTful

- It allows us to create, read, update, delete *resources*

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine — physical or virtual — in our cluster)

  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)

  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)

# First contact with `kubectl`

- `kubectl` is (almost) the only tool we'll need to talk to Kubernetes

- It is a rich CLI tool around the Kubernetes API

  (Everything you can do with `kubectl`, you can do directly with the API)

- On our machines, there is a `~/.kube/config` file with:

  - the Kubernetes API address

  - the path to our TLS certificates used to authenticate

- You can also use the `--kubeconfig` flag to pass a config file

- Or directly `--server`, `--user`, etc.

- `kubectl` can be pronounced "Cube C T L", "Cube cuttle", "Cube cuddle"...

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl get`

- Let's look at our `Node` resources with `kubectl get`!

.exercise[

- Look at the composition of our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node
  ```

- These commands are equivalent:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no
  kubectl get node
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Obtaining machine-readable output

- `kubectl get` can output JSON, YAML, or be directly formatted

.exercise[

- Give us more info about the nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Let's have some YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no -o yaml
  ```
  See that `kind: List` at the end? It's the type of our result!

---

## (Ab)using `kubectl` and `jq`

- It's super easy to build custom reports

.exercise[

- Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects:
  ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o json | 
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
  ```

## Exploring types and definitions

- We can list all available resource types by running `kubectl api-resources`
  <br/>
  (In Kubernetes 1.10 and prior, this command used to be `kubectl get`)

- We can view the definition for a resource type with:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain type
  ```

- We can view the definition of a field in a resource, for instance:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node.spec
  ```

- Or get the full definition of all fields and sub-fields:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node --recursive
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Introspection vs. documentation

- We can access the same information by reading the [API documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-reference)

- The API documentation is usually easier to read, but:

  - it won't show custom types (like Custom Resource Definitions)

  - we need to make sure that we look at the correct version

- `kubectl api-resources` and `kubectl explain` perform *introspection*

  (they communicate with the API server and obtain the exact type definitions)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Type names

- The most common resource names have three forms:

  - singular (e.g. `node`, `service`, `deployment`)

  - plural (e.g. `nodes`, `services`, `deployments`)

  - short (e.g. `no`, `svc`, `deploy`)

- Some resources do not have a short name

- `Endpoints` only have a plural form

  (because even a single `Endpoints` resource is actually a list of endpoints)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Viewing details

- We can use `kubectl get -o yaml` to see all available details

- However, YAML output is often simultaneously too much and not enough

- For instance, `kubectl get node node1 -o yaml` is:

  - too much information (e.g.: list of images available on this node)

  - not enough information (e.g.: doesn't show pods running on this node)

  - difficult to read for a human operator

- For a comprehensive overview, we can use `kubectl describe` instead

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl describe`

- `kubectl describe` needs a resource type and (optionally) a resource name

- It is possible to provide a resource name *prefix*

  (all matching objects will be displayed)

- `kubectl describe` will retrieve some extra information about the resource

.exercise[

- Look at the information available for `node1` with one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe node/node1
  kubectl describe node node1
  ```

]

(We should notice a bunch of control plane pods.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Services

- A *service* is a stable endpoint to connect to "something"

  (In the initial proposal, they were called "portals")

.exercise[

- List the services on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

--

There is already one service on our cluster: the Kubernetes API itself.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## ClusterIP services

- A `ClusterIP` service is internal, available from the cluster only

- This is useful for introspection from within containers

.exercise[

- Try to connect to the API:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`
  ```
  
  - `-k` is used to skip certificate verification

  - Make sure to replace 10.96.0.1 with the CLUSTER-IP shown by `kubectl get svc`

]

--

The error that we see is expected: the Kubernetes API requires authentication.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Listing running containers

- Containers are manipulated through *pods*

- A pod is a group of containers:

 - running together (on the same node)

 - sharing resources (RAM, CPU; but also network, volumes)

.exercise[

- List pods on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

--

*Where are the pods that we saw just a moment earlier?!?*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces

- Namespaces allow us to segregate resources

.exercise[

- List the namespaces on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces
  kubectl get namespace
  kubectl get ns
  ```

]

--

*You know what ... This `kube-system` thing looks suspicious.*

*In fact, I'm pretty sure it showed up earlier, when we did:*

`kubectl describe node node1`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Accessing namespaces

- By default, `kubectl` uses the `default` namespace

- We can see resources in all namespaces with `--all-namespaces`

.exercise[

- List the pods in all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

- Since Kubernetes 1.14, we can also use `-A` as a shorter version:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```

]

*Here are our system pods!*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## What are all these control plane pods?

- `etcd` is our etcd server

- `kube-apiserver` is the API server

- `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` are other control plane components

- `coredns` provides DNS-based service discovery ([replacing kube-dns as of 1.11](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/coredns-ga-for-kubernetes-cluster-dns/))

- `kube-proxy` is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such

- `weave` is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay

- the `READY` column indicates the number of containers in each pod

  (1 for most pods, but `weave` has 2, for instance)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Scoping another namespace

- We can also look at a different namespace (other than `default`)

.exercise[

- List only the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:

## Namespaces and other `kubectl` commands

- We can use `-n`/`--namespace` with almost every `kubectl` command

- Example:

  - `kubectl create --namespace=X` to create something in namespace X

- We can use `-A`/`--all-namespaces` with most commands that manipulate multiple objects

- Examples:

  - `kubectl delete` can delete resources across multiple namespaces

  - `kubectl label` can add/remove/update labels across multiple namespaces

## What about `kube-public`?

.exercise[

- List the pods in the `kube-public` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get pods

Nothing!

`kube-public` is created by kubeadm & [used for security bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/01/stronger-foundation-for-creating-and-managing-kubernetes-clusters).

## Exploring `kube-public`

- The only interesting object in `kube-public` is a ConfigMap named `cluster-info`

.exercise[

- List ConfigMap objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmaps
  ```

- Inspect `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmap cluster-info -o yaml
  ```

]

Note the `selfLink` URI: `/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info`

We can use that!

## Accessing `cluster-info`

- Earlier, when trying to access the API server, we got a `Forbidden` message

- But `cluster-info` is readable by everyone (even without authentication)

.exercise[

- Retrieve `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info
  ```

]

- We were able to access `cluster-info` (without auth)

- It contains a `kubeconfig` file

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Retrieving `kubeconfig`

- We can easily extract the `kubeconfig` file from this ConfigMap

.exercise[

- Display the content of `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
    curl -sk https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info \
         | jq -r .data.kubeconfig
  ```

]

- This file holds the canonical address of the API server, and the public key of the CA

- This file *does not* hold client keys or tokens

- This is not sensitive information, but allows us to establish trust

## What about `kube-node-lease`?

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, there is a `kube-node-lease` namespace

  (or in Kubernetes 1.13 if the NodeLease feature gate is enabled)

- That namespace contains one Lease object per node

- *Node leases* are a new way to implement node heartbeats

  (i.e. node regularly pinging the control plane to say "I'm alive!")

- For more details, see [KEP-0009] or the [node controller documentation]

# Running our first containers on Kubernetes

- First things first: we cannot run a container

--

- We are going to run a pod, and in that pod there will be a single container

--

- In that container in the pod, we are going to run a simple `ping` command

- Then we are going to start additional copies of the pod

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Starting a simple pod with `kubectl run`

- We need to specify at least a *name* and the image we want to use

.exercise[

- Let's ping `1.1.1.1`, Cloudflare's 
  [public DNS resolver](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/):
  ```bash
  kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 1.1.1.1
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait deploy/pingpong --for condition=available``` -->

]

--

(Starting with Kubernetes 1.12, we get a message telling us that
`kubectl run` is deprecated. Let's ignore it for now.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Behind the scenes of `kubectl run`

- Let's look at the resources that were created by `kubectl run`

.exercise[

- List most resource types:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We should see the following things:
- `deployment.apps/pingpong` (the *deployment* that we just created)
- `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx` (a *replica set* created by the deployment)
- `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy` (a *pod* created by the replica set)

Note: as of 1.10.1, resource types are displayed in more detail.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What are these different things?

- A *deployment* is a high-level construct

  - allows scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks

  - multiple deployments can be used together to implement a
    [canary deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments)

  - delegates pods management to *replica sets*

- A *replica set* is a low-level construct

  - makes sure that a given number of identical pods are running

  - allows scaling

  - rarely used directly

- A *replication controller* is the (deprecated) predecessor of a replica set

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Our `pingpong` deployment

- `kubectl run` created a *deployment*, `deployment.apps/pingpong`

```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/pingpong   1         1         1            1           10m
```

- That deployment created a *replica set*, `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`

```
NAME                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicaset.apps/pingpong-7c8bbcd9bc   1         1         1         10m
```

- That replica set created a *pod*, `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`

```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pingpong-7c8bbcd9bc-6c9qz   1/1       Running   0          10m
```

- We'll see later how these folks play together for:

  - scaling, high availability, rolling updates

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Viewing container output

- Let's use the `kubectl logs` command

- We will pass either a *pod name*, or a *type/name*

  (E.g. if we specify a deployment or replica set, it will get the first pod in it)

- Unless specified otherwise, it will only show logs of the first container in the pod

  (Good thing there's only one in ours!)

.exercise[

- View the result of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Streaming logs in real time

- Just like `docker logs`, `kubectl logs` supports convenient options:

  - `-f`/`--follow` to stream logs in real time (à la `tail -f`)

  - `--tail` to indicate how many lines you want to see (from the end)

  - `--since` to get logs only after a given timestamp

.exercise[

- View the latest logs of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 1 --follow
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=3```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Scaling our application

- We can create additional copies of our container (I mean, our pod) with `kubectl scale`

.exercise[

- Scale our `pingpong` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deploy/pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Note that this command does exactly the same thing:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

]

Note: what if we tried to scale `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`?

We could! But the *deployment* would notice it right away, and scale back to the initial level.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Resilience

- The *deployment* `pingpong` watches its *replica set*

- The *replica set* ensures that the right number of *pods* are running

- What happens if pods disappear?

.exercise[

- In a separate window, list pods, and keep watching them:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!--
```wait Running```
```keys ^C```
```hide kubectl wait deploy pingpong --for condition=available```
```keys kubectl delete pod ping```
```copypaste pong-..........-.....```
-->

- Destroy a pod:
  ```
  kubectl delete pod pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```
]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What if we wanted something different?

- What if we wanted to start a "one-shot" container that *doesn't* get restarted?

- We could use `kubectl run --restart=OnFailure` or `kubectl run --restart=Never`

- These commands would create *jobs* or *pods* instead of *deployments*

- Under the hood, `kubectl run` invokes "generators" to create resource descriptions

- We could also write these resource descriptions ourselves (typically in YAML),
  <br/>and create them on the cluster with `kubectl apply -f` (discussed later)

- With `kubectl run --schedule=...`, we can also create *cronjobs*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## What about that deprecation warning?

- As we can see from the previous slide, `kubectl run` can do many things

- The exact type of resource created is not obvious

- To make things more explicit, it is better to use `kubectl create`:

  - `kubectl create deployment` to create a deployment

  - `kubectl create job` to create a job

  - `kubectl create cronjob` to run a job periodically
    <br/>(since Kubernetes 1.14)

- Eventually, `kubectl run` will be used only to start one-shot pods

  (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68132)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Various ways of creating resources

- `kubectl run` 

  - easy way to get started
  - versatile

- `kubectl create <resource>` 

  - explicit, but lacks some features
  - can't create a CronJob before Kubernetes 1.14
  - can't pass command-line arguments to deployments

- `kubectl create -f foo.yaml` or `kubectl apply -f foo.yaml`

  - all features are available
  - requires writing YAML

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Viewing logs of multiple pods

- When we specify a deployment name, only one single pod's logs are shown

- We can view the logs of multiple pods by specifying a *selector*

- A selector is a logic expression using *labels*

- Conveniently, when you `kubectl run somename`, the associated objects have a `run=somename` label

.exercise[

- View the last line of log from all pods with the `run=pingpong` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

### Streaming logs of multiple pods

- Can we stream the logs of all our `pingpong` pods?

.exercise[

- Combine `-l` and `-f` flags:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

<!--
```wait seq=```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

*Note: combining `-l` and `-f` is only possible since Kubernetes 1.14!*

*Let's try to understand why ...*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

class: extra-details

### Streaming logs of many pods

- Let's see what happens if we try to stream the logs for more than 5 pods

.exercise[

- Scale up our deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas=8
  ```

- Stream the logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l run=pingpong --tail 1 -f
  ```

]

We see a message like the following one:
```
error: you are attempting to follow 8 log streams,
but maximum allowed concurency is 5,
use --max-log-requests to increase the limit
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why can't we stream the logs of many pods?

- `kubectl` opens one connection to the API server per pod

- For each pod, the API server opens one extra connection to the corresponding kubelet

- If there are 1000 pods in our deployment, that's 1000 inbound + 1000 outbound connections on the API server

- This could easily put a lot of stress on the API server

- Prior Kubernetes 1.14, it was decided to *not* allow multiple connections

- From Kubernetes 1.14, it is allowed, but limited to 5 connections

  (this can be changed with `--max-log-requests`)

- For more details about the rationale, see
  [PR #67573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67573)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of `kubectl logs`

- We don't see which pod sent which log line

- If pods are restarted / replaced, the log stream stops

- If new pods are added, we don't see their logs

- To stream the logs of multiple pods, we need to write a selector

- There are external tools to address these shortcomings

  (e.g.: [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern))

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `kubectl logs -l ... --tail N`

- If we run this with Kubernetes 1.12, the last command shows multiple lines

- This is a regression when `--tail` is used together with `-l`/`--selector`

- It always shows the last 10 lines of output for each container

  (instead of the number of lines specified on the command line)

- The problem was fixed in Kubernetes 1.13

*See [#70554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70554) for details.*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlrun.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlrun.md)]
---

## Aren't we flooding 1.1.1.1?

- If you're wondering this, good question!

- Don't worry, though:

  *APNIC's research group held the IP addresses 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. While the addresses were valid, so many people had entered them into various random systems that they were continuously overwhelmed by a flood of garbage traffic. APNIC wanted to study this garbage traffic but any time they'd tried to announce the IPs, the flood would overwhelm any conventional network.*

  (Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/)

- It's very unlikely that our concerted pings manage to produce
  even a modest blip at Cloudflare's NOC!

# Accessing logs from the CLI

- The `kubectl logs` command has limitations:

  - it cannot stream logs from multiple pods at a time

  - when showing logs from multiple pods, it mixes them all together

- We are going to see how to do it better

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Doing it manually

- We *could* (if we were so inclined) write a program or script that would:

  - take a selector as an argument

  - enumerate all pods matching that selector (with `kubectl get -l ...`)

  - fork one `kubectl logs --follow ...` command per container

  - annotate the logs (the output of each `kubectl logs ...` process) with their origin

  - preserve ordering by using `kubectl logs --timestamps ...` and merge the output

--

- We *could* do it, but thankfully, others did it for us already!

## Stern

[Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) is an open source project
by [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

From the README:

*Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.*

*The query is a regular expression so the pod name can easily be filtered and you don't need to specify the exact id (for instance omitting the deployment id). If a pod is deleted it gets removed from tail and if a new pod is added it automatically gets tailed.*

Exactly what we need!

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Installing Stern

- Run `stern` (without arguments) to check if it's installed:

  ```
  $ stern
  Tail multiple pods and containers from Kubernetes

  Usage:
    stern pod-query [flags]
  ```

- If it is not installed, the easiest method is to download a [binary release](https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases)

- The following commands will install Stern on a Linux Intel 64 bit machine:
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/stern \
       https://github.com/wercker/stern/releases/download/1.11.0/stern_linux_amd64
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stern
  ```

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern

- There are two ways to specify the pods whose logs we want to see:

  - `-l` followed by a selector expression (like with many `kubectl` commands)

  - with a "pod query," i.e. a regex used to match pod names

- These two ways can be combined if necessary

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the rng containers:
  ```bash
  stern rng
  ```

<!--
```wait HTTP/1.1```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Stern convenient options

- The `--tail N` flag shows the last `N` lines for each container

  (Instead of showing the logs since the creation of the container)

- The `-t` / `--timestamps` flag shows timestamps

- The `--all-namespaces` flag is self-explanatory

.exercise[

- View what's up with the `weave` system containers:
  ```bash
  stern --tail 1 --timestamps --all-namespaces weave
  ```

<!--
```wait weave-npc```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/logs-cli.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/logs-cli.md)]
---

## Using Stern with a selector

- When specifying a selector, we can omit the value for a label

- This will match all objects having that label (regardless of the value)

- Everything created with `kubectl run` has a label `run`

- We can use that property to view the logs of all the pods created with `kubectl run`

- Similarly, everything created with `kubectl create deployment` has a label `app`

.exercise[

- View the logs for all the things started with `kubectl create deployment`:
  ```bash
  stern -l app
  ```

<!--
```wait units of work```
```keys ^C```
-->

# Declarative vs imperative

- Our container orchestrator puts a very strong emphasis on being *declarative*

- Declarative:

  *I would like a cup of tea.*

- Imperative:

  *Boil some water. Pour it in a teapot. Add tea leaves. Steep for a while. Serve in a cup.*

--

- Declarative seems simpler at first ... 

--

- ... As long as you know how to brew tea

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- What declarative would really be:

  *I want a cup of tea, obtained by pouring an infusion¹ of tea leaves in a cup.*

--

  *¹An infusion is obtained by letting the object steep a few minutes in hot² water.*

--

  *²Hot liquid is obtained by pouring it in an appropriate container³ and setting it on a stove.*

--

  *³Ah, finally, containers! Something we know about. Let's get to work, shall we?*

--

.footnote[Did you know there was an [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103)
specifying how to brew tea?]

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---

## Declarative vs imperative

- Imperative systems:

  - simpler

  - if a task is interrupted, we have to restart from scratch

- Declarative systems:

  - if a task is interrupted (or if we show up to the party half-way through),
    we can figure out what's missing and do only what's necessary

  - we need to be able to *observe* the system

  - ... and compute a "diff" between *what we have* and *what we want*

.debug[[shared/declarative.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/shared/declarative.md)]
---
## Declarative vs imperative in Kubernetes

- With Kubernetes, we cannot say: "run this container"

- All we can do is write a *spec* and push it to the API server

  (by creating a resource like e.g. a Pod or a Deployment)

- The API server will validate that spec (and reject it if it's invalid)

- Then it will store it in etcd

- A *controller* will "notice" that spec and act upon it

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Reconciling state

- Watch for the `spec` fields in the YAML files later!

- The *spec* describes *how we want the thing to be*

- Kubernetes will *reconcile* the current state with the spec
  <br/>(technically, this is done by a number of *controllers*)

- When we want to change some resource, we update the *spec*

- Kubernetes will then *converge* that resource

# Kubernetes network model

- TL,DR:

  *Our cluster (nodes and pods) is one big flat IP network.*

--

- In detail:

 - all nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - all pods must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - pods and nodes must be able to reach each other, without NAT

 - each pod is aware of its IP address (no NAT)

 - pod IP addresses are assigned by the network implementation

- Kubernetes doesn't mandate any particular implementation

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the good

- Everything can reach everything

- No address translation

- No port translation

- No new protocol

- The network implementation can decide how to allocate addresses

- IP addresses don't have to be "portable" from a node to another

  (We can use e.g. a subnet per node and use a simple routed topology)

- The specification is simple enough to allow many various implementations

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: the less good

- Everything can reach everything

  - if you want security, you need to add network policies

  - the network implementation that you use needs to support them

- There are literally dozens of implementations out there

  (15 are listed in the Kubernetes documentation)

- Pods have level 3 (IP) connectivity, but *services* are level 4 (TCP or UDP)

  (Services map to a single UDP or TCP port; no port ranges or arbitrary IP packets)

- `kube-proxy` is on the data path when connecting to a pod or container,
  <br/>and it's not particularly fast (relies on userland proxying or iptables)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

## Kubernetes network model: in practice

- The nodes that we are using have been set up to use [Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)

- We don't endorse Weave in a particular way, it just Works For Us

- Don't worry about the warning about `kube-proxy` performance

- Unless you:

  - routinely saturate 10G network interfaces
  - count packet rates in millions per second
  - run high-traffic VOIP or gaming platforms
  - do weird things that involve millions of simultaneous connections
    <br/>(in which case you're already familiar with kernel tuning)

- If necessary, there are alternatives to `kube-proxy`; e.g.
  [`kube-router`](https://www.kube-router.io)

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The Container Network Interface (CNI)

- Most Kubernetes clusters use CNI "plugins" to implement networking

- When a pod is created, Kubernetes delegates the network setup to these plugins

  (it can be a single plugin, or a combination of plugins, each doing one task)

- Typically, CNI plugins will:

  - allocate an IP address (by calling an IPAM plugin)

  - add a network interface into the pod's network namespace

  - configure the interface as well as required routes etc.

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Multiple moving parts

- The "pod-to-pod network" or "pod network":

  - provides communication between pods and nodes

  - is generally implemented with CNI plugins

- The "pod-to-service network":

  - provides internal communication and load balancing

  - is generally implemented with kube-proxy (or e.g. kube-router)

- Network policies:

  - provide firewalling and isolation

  - can be bundled with the "pod network" or provided by another component

.debug[[k8s/kubenet.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubenet.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Even more moving parts

- Inbound traffic can be handled by multiple components:

  - something like kube-proxy or kube-router (for NodePort services)

  - load balancers (ideally, connected to the pod network)

- It is possible to use multiple pod networks in parallel

  (with "meta-plugins" like CNI-Genie or Multus)

- Some solutions can fill multiple roles

  (e.g. kube-router can be set up to provide the pod network and/or network policies and/or replace kube-proxy)

# Exposing containers

- `kubectl expose` creates a *service* for existing pods

- A *service* is a stable address for a pod (or a bunch of pods)

- If we want to connect to our pod(s), we need to create a *service*

- Once a service is created, CoreDNS will allow us to resolve it by name

  (i.e. after creating service `hello`, the name `hello` will resolve to something)

- There are different types of services, detailed on the following slides:

  `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Basic service types

- `ClusterIP` (default type)

  - a virtual IP address is allocated for the service (in an internal, private range)
  - this IP address is reachable only from within the cluster (nodes and pods)
  - our code can connect to the service using the original port number

- `NodePort`

  - a port is allocated for the service (by default, in the 30000-32768 range)
  - that port is made available *on all our nodes* and anybody can connect to it
  - our code must be changed to connect to that new port number

These service types are always available.

Under the hood: `kube-proxy` is using a userland proxy and a bunch of `iptables` rules.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## More service types

- `LoadBalancer`

  - an external load balancer is allocated for the service
  - the load balancer is configured accordingly
    <br/>(e.g.: a `NodePort` service is created, and the load balancer sends traffic to that port)
  - available only when the underlying infrastructure provides some "load balancer as a service"
    <br/>(e.g. AWS, Azure, GCE, OpenStack...)

- `ExternalName`

  - the DNS entry managed by CoreDNS will just be a `CNAME` to a provided record
  - no port, no IP address, no nothing else is allocated

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Running containers with open ports

- Since `ping` doesn't have anything to connect to, we'll have to run something else

- We could use the `nginx` official image, but ...

  ... we wouldn't be able to tell the backends from each other!

- We are going to use `jpetazzo/httpenv`, a tiny HTTP server written in Go

- `jpetazzo/httpenv` listens on port 8888

- It serves its environment variables in JSON format

- The environment variables will include `HOSTNAME`, which will be the pod name

  (and therefore, will be different on each backend)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Creating a deployment for our HTTP server

- We *could* do `kubectl run httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv` ...

- But since `kubectl run` is being deprecated, let's see how to use `kubectl create` instead

.exercise[

- In another window, watch the pods (to see when they are created):
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^C``` -->

- Create a deployment for this very lightweight HTTP server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment httpenv --image=jpetazzo/httpenv
  ```

- Scale it to 10 replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment httpenv --replicas=10
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Exposing our deployment

- We'll create a default `ClusterIP` service

.exercise[

- Expose the HTTP port of our server:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment httpenv --port 8888
  ```

- Look up which IP address was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Services are layer 4 constructs

- You can assign IP addresses to services, but they are still *layer 4*

  (i.e. a service is not an IP address; it's an IP address + protocol + port)

- This is caused by the current implementation of `kube-proxy`

  (it relies on mechanisms that don't support layer 3)

- As a result: you *have to* indicate the port number for your service
    
- Running services with arbitrary port (or port ranges) requires hacks

  (e.g. host networking mode)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Testing our service

- We will now send a few HTTP requests to our pods

.exercise[

- Let's obtain the IP address that was allocated for our service, *programmatically:*
  ```bash
  IP=$(kubectl get svc httpenv -o go-template --template '{{ .spec.clusterIP }}')
  ```

<!--
```hide kubectl wait deploy httpenv --for condition=available```
-->

- Send a few requests:
  ```bash
  curl http://$IP:8888/
  ```

- Too much output? Filter it with `jq`:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://$IP:8888/ | jq .HOSTNAME
  ```

]

--

Try it a few times! Our requests are load balanced across multiple pods.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## If we don't need a load balancer

- Sometimes, we want to access our scaled services directly:

  - if we want to save a tiny little bit of latency (typically less than 1ms)

  - if we need to connect over arbitrary ports (instead of a few fixed ones)

  - if we need to communicate over another protocol than UDP or TCP

  - if we want to decide how to balance the requests client-side

  - ...

- In that case, we can use a "headless service"

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Headless services

- A headless service is obtained by setting the `clusterIP` field to `None`

  (Either with `--cluster-ip=None`, or by providing a custom YAML)

- As a result, the service doesn't have a virtual IP address

- Since there is no virtual IP address, there is no load balancer either

- CoreDNS will return the pods' IP addresses as multiple `A` records

- This gives us an easy way to discover all the replicas for a deployment

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Services and endpoints

- A service has a number of "endpoints"

- Each endpoint is a host + port where the service is available

- The endpoints are maintained and updated automatically by Kubernetes

.exercise[

- Check the endpoints that Kubernetes has associated with our `httpenv` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service httpenv
  ```

]

In the output, there will be a line starting with `Endpoints:`.

That line will list a bunch of addresses in `host:port` format.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Viewing endpoint details

- When we have many endpoints, our display commands truncate the list
  ```bash
  kubectl get endpoints
  ```

- If we want to see the full list, we can use one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe endpoints httpenv
  kubectl get endpoints httpenv -o yaml
  ```

- These commands will show us a list of IP addresses

- These IP addresses should match the addresses of the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=httpenv -o wide
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## `endpoints` not `endpoint`

- `endpoints` is the only resource that cannot be singular

```bash
$ kubectl get endpoint
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "endpoint"
```

- This is because the type itself is plural (unlike every other resource)

- There is no `endpoint` object: `type Endpoints struct`

- The type doesn't represent a single endpoint, but a list of endpoints

.debug[[k8s/kubectlexpose.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlexpose.md)]
---

## Exposing services to the outside world

- The default type (ClusterIP) only works for internal traffic

- If we want to accept external traffic, we can use one of these:

  - NodePort (expose a service on a TCP port between 30000-32768)

  - LoadBalancer (provision a cloud load balancer for our service)

  - ExternalIP (use one node's external IP address)

  - Ingress (a special mechanism for HTTP services)

*We'll see NodePorts and Ingresses more in detail later.*

# Shipping images with a registry

- Initially, our app was running on a single node

- We could *build* and *run* in the same place

- Therefore, we did not need to *ship* anything

- Now that we want to run on a cluster, things are different

- The easiest way to ship container images is to use a registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## How Docker registries work (a reminder)

- What happens when we execute `docker run alpine` ?

- If the Engine needs to pull the `alpine` image, it expands it into `library/alpine`

- `library/alpine` is expanded into `index.docker.io/library/alpine`

- The Engine communicates with `index.docker.io` to retrieve `library/alpine:latest`

- To use something else than `index.docker.io`, we specify it in the image name

- Examples:
  ```bash
  docker pull gcr.io/google-containers/alpine-with-bash:1.0

  docker build -t registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome .
  docker push registry.mycompany.io:5000/myimage:awesome
  ```

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Running DockerCoins on Kubernetes

- Create one deployment for each component

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui, worker)

- Expose deployments that need to accept connections

  (hasher, redis, rng, webui)

- For redis, we can use the official redis image

- For the 4 others, we need to build images and push them to some registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Building and shipping images

- There are *many* options!

- Manually:

  - build locally (with `docker build` or otherwise)

  - push to the registry

- Automatically:

  - build and test locally

  - when ready, commit and push a code repository

  - the code repository notifies an automated build system

  - that system gets the code, builds it, pushes the image to the registry

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---

## Which registry do we want to use?

- There are SAAS products like Docker Hub, Quay ...

- Each major cloud provider has an option as well

  (ACR on Azure, ECR on AWS, GCR on Google Cloud...)

- There are also commercial products to run our own registry

  (Docker EE, Quay...)

- And open source options, too!

- When picking a registry, pay attention to its build system

  (when it has one)

.debug[[k8s/shippingimages.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/shippingimages.md)]
---
## Using images from the Docker Hub

- For everyone's convenience, we took care of building DockerCoins images

- We pushed these images to the DockerHub, under the [dockercoins](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockercoins) user

- These images are *tagged* with a version number, `v0.1`

- The full image names are therefore:

  - `dockercoins/hasher:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/rng:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/webui:v0.1`

  - `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`

.debug[[k8s/buildshiprun-dockerhub.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/buildshiprun-dockerhub.md)]
---

## Setting `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG`

- In the upcoming exercises and labs, we use a couple of environment variables:

  - `$REGISTRY` as a prefix to all image names

  - `$TAG` as the image version tag

- For example, the worker image is `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG`

- If you copy-paste the commands in these exercises:

  **make sure that you set `$REGISTRY` and `$TAG` first!**

- For example:
  ```
  export REGISTRY=dockercoins TAG=v0.1
  ```

  (this will expand `$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG` to `dockercoins/worker:v0.1`)

  (Hint: use `kubectl get deploy -w` to watch deployment events)

.exercise[

<!-- ```hide
kubectl wait deploy/rng --for condition=available
kubectl wait deploy/worker --for condition=available
``` -->

- Look at some logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/rng
  kubectl logs deploy/worker
  ```

]

--

🤔 `rng` is fine ... But not `worker`.

--

💡 Oh right! We forgot to `expose`.

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Connecting containers together

- Three deployments need to be reachable by others: `hasher`, `redis`, `rng`

- `worker` doesn't need to be exposed

- `webui` will be dealt with later

.exercise[

- Expose each deployment, specifying the right port:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment redis --port 6379
  kubectl expose deployment rng --port 80
  kubectl expose deployment hasher --port 80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Is this working yet?

- The `worker` has an infinite loop, that retries 10 seconds after an error

.exercise[

- Stream the worker's logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/worker --follow
  ```

  (Give it about 10 seconds to recover)

<!--
```wait units of work done, updating hash counter```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

--

We should now see the `worker`, well, working happily.

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Exposing services for external access

- Now we would like to access the Web UI

- We will expose it with a `NodePort`

  (just like we did for the registry)

.exercise[

- Create a `NodePort` service for the Web UI:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deploy/webui --type=NodePort --port=80
  ```

- Check the port that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/ourapponkube.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/ourapponkube.md)]
---

## Accessing the web UI

- We can now connect to *any node*, on the allocated node port, to view the web UI

.exercise[

- Open the web UI in your browser (http://node-ip-address:3xxxx/)

<!-- ```open http://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

--

Yes, this may take a little while to update. *(Narrator: it was DNS.)*

--

*Alright, we're back to where we started, when we were running on a single node!*

# Scaling our demo app

- Our ultimate goal is to get more DockerCoins

  (i.e. increase the number of loops per second shown on the web UI)

- Let's look at the architecture again:

  ![DockerCoins architecture](images/dockercoins-diagram.svg)

- The loop is done in the worker;
  perhaps we could try adding more workers?

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding another worker

- All we have to do is scale the `worker` Deployment

.exercise[

- Open two new terminals to check what's going on with pods and deployments:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!--
```wait RESTARTS```
```keys ^C```
```wait AVAILABLE```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Now, create more `worker` replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=2
  ```

]

After a few seconds, the graph in the web UI should show up.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding more workers

- If 2 workers give us 2x speed, what about 3 workers?

.exercise[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment further:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=3
  ```

]

The graph in the web UI should go up again.

(This is looking great! We're gonna be RICH!)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Adding even more workers

- Let's see if 10 workers give us 10x speed!

.exercise[

- Scale the `worker` Deployment to a bigger number:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=10
  ```

]

--

The graph will peak at 10 hashes/second.

(We can add as many workers as we want: we will never go past 10 hashes/second.)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Didn't we briefly exceed 10 hashes/second?

- It may *look like it*, because the web UI shows instant speed

- The instant speed can briefly exceed 10 hashes/second

- The average speed cannot

- The instant speed can be biased because of how it's computed

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Why instant speed is misleading

- The instant speed is computed client-side by the web UI

- The web UI checks the hash counter once per second
  <br/>
  (and does a classic (h2-h1)/(t2-t1) speed computation)

- The counter is updated once per second by the workers

- These timings are not exact
  <br/>
  (e.g. the web UI check interval is client-side JavaScript)

- Sometimes, between two web UI counter measurements,
  <br/>
  the workers are able to update the counter *twice*

- During that cycle, the instant speed will appear to be much bigger
  <br/>
  (but it will be compensated by lower instant speed before and after)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Why are we stuck at 10 hashes per second?

- If this was high-quality, production code, we would have instrumentation

  (Datadog, Honeycomb, New Relic, statsd, Sumologic, ...)

- It's not!

- Perhaps we could benchmark our web services?

  (with tools like `ab`, or even simpler, `httping`)

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Benchmarking our web services

- We want to check `hasher` and `rng`

- We are going to use `httping`

- It's just like `ping`, but using HTTP `GET` requests

  (it measures how long it takes to perform one `GET` request)

- It's used like this:
  ```
  httping [-c count] http://host:port/path
  ```

- Or even simpler:
  ```
  httping ip.ad.dr.ess
  ```

- We will use `httping` on the ClusterIP addresses of our services

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Obtaining ClusterIP addresses

- We can simply check the output of `kubectl get services`

- Or do it programmatically, as in the example below

.exercise[

- Retrieve the IP addresses:
  ```bash
  HASHER=$(kubectl get svc hasher -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  RNG=$(kubectl get svc rng -o go-template={{.spec.clusterIP}})
  ```

]

Now we can access the IP addresses of our services through `$HASHER` and `$RNG`.

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---

## Checking `hasher` and `rng` response times

.exercise[

- Check the response times for both services:
  ```bash
  httping -c 3 $HASHER
  httping -c 3 $RNG
  ```

]

- `hasher` is fine (it should take a few milliseconds to reply)

- `rng` is not (it should take about 700 milliseconds if there are 10 workers)

- Something is wrong with `rng`, but ... what?

.debug[[k8s/scalingdockercoins.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/scalingdockercoins.md)]
---
## Let's draw hasty conclusions

- The bottleneck seems to be `rng`

- *What if* we don't have enough entropy and can't generate enough random numbers?

- We need to scale out the `rng` service on multiple machines!

Note: this is a fiction! We have enough entropy. But we need a pretext to scale out.

(In fact, the code of `rng` uses `/dev/urandom`, which never runs out of entropy...
<br/>
...and is [just as good as `/dev/random`](http://www.slideshare.net/PacSecJP/filippo-plain-simple-reality-of-entropy).)

# Daemon sets

- We want to scale `rng` in a way that is different from how we scaled `worker`

- We want one (and exactly one) instance of `rng` per node

- We *do not want* two instances of `rng` on the same node

- We will do that with a *daemon set*

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Why not a deployment?

- Can't we just do `kubectl scale deployment rng --replicas=...`?

--

- Nothing guarantees that the `rng` containers will be distributed evenly

- If we add nodes later, they will not automatically run a copy of `rng`

- If we remove (or reboot) a node, one `rng` container will restart elsewhere

  (and we will end up with two instances `rng` on the same node)

- By contrast, a daemon set will start one pod per node and keep it that way

  (as nodes are added or removed)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Daemon sets in practice

- Daemon sets are great for cluster-wide, per-node processes:

  - `kube-proxy`

  - `weave` (our overlay network)

  - monitoring agents

  - hardware management tools (e.g. SCSI/FC HBA agents)

  - etc.

- They can also be restricted to run [only on some nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#running-pods-on-only-some-nodes)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating a daemon set

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Unfortunately, as of Kubernetes 1.15, the CLI cannot create daemon sets

--

- More precisely: it doesn't have a subcommand to create a daemon set

--

- But any kind of resource can always be created by providing a YAML description:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f foo.yaml
  ```

--

- How do we create the YAML file for our daemon set?

--

  - option 1: [read the docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#create-a-daemonset)

--

  - option 2: `vi` our way out of it

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Creating the YAML file for our daemon set

- Let's start with the YAML file for the current `rng` resource

.exercise[

- Dump the `rng` resource in YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get deploy/rng -o yaml >rng.yml
  ```

- Edit `rng.yml`

]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## "Casting" a resource to another

- What if we just changed the `kind` field?

  (It can't be that easy, right?)

.exercise[

- Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: DaemonSet`

<!--
```bash vim rng.yml```
```wait kind: Deployment```
```keys /Deployment```
```keys ^J```
```keys cwDaemonSet```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Save, quit

- Try to create our new resource:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml
  ```

]

--

We all knew this couldn't be that easy, right!

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Understanding the problem

- The core of the error is:
  ```
  error validating data:
  [ValidationError(DaemonSet.spec):
  unknown field "replicas" in io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.DaemonSetSpec,
  ...
  ```

--

- *Obviously,* it doesn't make sense to specify a number of replicas for a daemon set

--

- Workaround: fix the YAML

  - remove the `replicas` field
  - remove the `strategy` field (which defines the rollout mechanism for a deployment)
  - remove the `progressDeadlineSeconds` field (also used by the rollout mechanism)
  - remove the `status: {}` line at the end

--

- Or, we could also ...

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Use the `--force`, Luke

- We could also tell Kubernetes to ignore these errors and try anyway

- The `--force` flag's actual name is `--validate=false`

.exercise[

- Try to load our YAML file and ignore errors:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f rng.yml --validate=false
  ```

]

--

🎩✨🐇

--

Wait ... Now, can it be *that* easy?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Checking what we've done

- Did we transform our `deployment` into a `daemonset`?

.exercise[

- Look at the resources that we have now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

We have two resources called `rng`:

- the *deployment* that was existing before

- the *daemon set* that we just created

We also have one too many pods.
<br/>
(The pod corresponding to the *deployment* still exists.)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## `deploy/rng` and `ds/rng`

- You can have different resource types with the same name

  (i.e. a *deployment* and a *daemon set* both named `rng`)

- We still have the old `rng` *deployment*

  ```
NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/rng        1         1         1            1           18m
  ```

- But now we have the new `rng` *daemon set* as well

  ```
NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  NODE SELECTOR  AGE
daemonset.apps/rng  2        2        2      2           2          <none>         9s
  ```

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Too many pods

- If we check with `kubectl get pods`, we see:

  - *one pod* for the deployment (named `rng-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`)

  - *one pod per node* for the daemon set (named `rng-zzzzz`)

  ```
  NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  rng-54f57d4d49-7pt82        1/1       Running   0          11m
  rng-b85tm                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  rng-hfbrr                   1/1       Running   0          25s
  [...]
  ```

--

The daemon set created one pod per node, except on the master node.

The master node has [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) preventing pods from running there.

(To schedule a pod on this node anyway, the pod will require appropriate [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).)

.footnote[(Off by one? We don't run these pods on the node hosting the control plane.)]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Is this working?

- Look at the web UI

--

- The graph should now go above 10 hashes per second!

--

- It looks like the newly created pods are serving traffic correctly

- How and why did this happen?

  (We didn't do anything special to add them to the `rng` service load balancer!)

# Labels and selectors

- The `rng` *service* is load balancing requests to a set of pods

- That set of pods is defined by the *selector* of the `rng` service

.exercise[

- Check the *selector* in the `rng` service definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe service rng
  ```

]

- The selector is `app=rng`

- It means "all the pods having the label `app=rng`"

  (They can have additional labels as well, that's OK!)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selector evaluation

- We can use selectors with many `kubectl` commands

- For instance, with `kubectl get`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl delete` ... and more

.exercise[

- Get the list of pods matching selector `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=rng
  kubectl get pods --selector app=rng
  ```

]

But ... why do these pods (in particular, the *new* ones) have this `app=rng` label?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Where do labels come from?

- When we create a deployment with `kubectl create deployment rng`,
  <br/>this deployment gets the label `app=rng`

- The replica sets created by this deployment also get the label `app=rng`

- The pods created by these replica sets also get the label `app=rng`

- When we created the daemon set from the deployment, we re-used the same spec

- Therefore, the pods created by the daemon set get the same labels

.footnote[Note: when we use `kubectl run stuff`, the label is `run=stuff` instead.]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating load balancer configuration

- We would like to remove a pod from the load balancer

- What would happen if we removed that pod, with `kubectl delete pod ...`?

--

  It would be re-created immediately (by the replica set or the daemon set)

--

- What would happen if we removed the `app=rng` label from that pod?

--

  It would *also* be re-created immediately

--

  Why?!?

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Selectors for replica sets and daemon sets

- The "mission" of a replica set is:

  "Make sure that there is the right number of pods matching this spec!"

- The "mission" of a daemon set is:

  "Make sure that there is a pod matching this spec on each node!"

--

- *In fact,* replica sets and daemon sets do not check pod specifications

- They merely have a *selector*, and they look for pods matching that selector

- Yes, we can fool them by manually creating pods with the "right" labels

- Bottom line: if we remove our `app=rng` label ...

 ... The pod "disappears" for its parent, which re-creates another pod to replace it

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Isolation of replica sets and daemon sets

- Since both the `rng` daemon set and the `rng` replica set use `app=rng` ...

  ... Why don't they "find" each other's pods?

--

- *Replica sets* have a more specific selector, visible with `kubectl describe`

  (It looks like `app=rng,pod-template-hash=abcd1234`)

- *Daemon sets* also have a more specific selector, but it's invisible

  (It looks like `app=rng,controller-revision-hash=abcd1234`)

- As a result, each controller only "sees" the pods it manages

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

- Currently, the `rng` service is defined by the `app=rng` selector

- The only way to remove a pod is to remove or change the `app` label

- ... But that will cause another pod to be created instead!

- What's the solution?

--

- We need to change the selector of the `rng` service!

- Let's add another label to that selector (e.g. `enabled=yes`) 

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Complex selectors

- If a selector specifies multiple labels, they are understood as a logical *AND*

  (In other words: the pods must match all the labels)

- Kubernetes has support for advanced, set-based selectors

  (But these cannot be used with services, at least not yet!)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## The plan

1. Add the label `enabled=yes` to all our `rng` pods

2. Update the selector for the `rng` service to also include `enabled=yes`

3. Toggle traffic to a pod by manually adding/removing the `enabled` label

4. Profit!

*Note: if we swap steps 1 and 2, it will cause a short
service disruption, because there will be a period of time
during which the service selector won't match any pod.
During that time, requests to the service will time out.
By doing things in the order above, we guarantee that there won't
be any interruption.*

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Adding labels to pods

- We want to add the label `enabled=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`

- We could edit each pod one by one with `kubectl edit` ...

- ... Or we could use `kubectl label` to label them all

- `kubectl label` can use selectors itself

.exercise[

- Add `enabled=yes` to all pods that have `app=rng`:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pods -l app=rng enabled=yes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating the service selector

- We need to edit the service specification

- Reminder: in the service definition, we will see `app: rng` in two places

  - the label of the service itself (we don't need to touch that one)

  - the selector of the service (that's the one we want to change)

.exercise[

- Update the service to add `enabled: yes` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /app: rng```
```keys ^J```
```keys noenabled: yes```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

]

... And then we get *the weirdest error ever.* Why?

---

## When the YAML parser is being too smart

- YAML parsers try to help us:

  - `xyz` is the string `"xyz"`

  - `42` is the integer `42`

  - `yes` is the boolean value `true`

- If we want the string `"42"` or the string `"yes"`, we have to quote them

- So we have to use `enabled: "yes"`

.footnote[For a good laugh: if we had used "ja", "oui", "si" ... as the value, it would have worked!]

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]

## Updating the service selector, take 2

.exercise[

- Update the service to add `enabled: "yes"` to its selector:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit service rng
  ```

<!--
```wait Please edit the object below```
```keys /app: rng```
```keys ^J```
```keys noenabled: "yes"```
```keys ^[``` ]
```keys :wq```
```keys ^J```
-->

]

This time it should work!

If we did everything correctly, the web UI shouldn't show any change.

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Updating labels

- We want to disable the pod that was created by the deployment

- All we have to do, is remove the `enabled` label from that pod

- To identify that pod, we can use its name

- ... Or rely on the fact that it's the only one with a `pod-template-hash` label

- Good to know:

  - `kubectl label ... foo=` doesn't remove a label (it sets it to an empty string)

  - to remove label `foo`, use `kubectl label ... foo-`

  - to change an existing label, we would need to add `--overwrite`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Removing a pod from the load balancer

.exercise[

- In one window, check the logs of that pod:
  ```bash
  POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash -o name)
  kubectl logs --tail 1 --follow $POD

  ```
  (We should see a steady stream of HTTP logs)

- In another window, remove the label from the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl label pod -l app=rng,pod-template-hash enabled-
  ```
  (The stream of HTTP logs should stop immediately)

]

There might be a slight change in the web UI (since we removed a bit
of capacity from the `rng` service). If we remove more pods,
the effect should be more visible.

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Updating the daemon set

- If we scale up our cluster by adding new nodes, the daemon set will create more pods

- These pods won't have the `enabled=yes` label

- If we want these pods to have that label, we need to edit the daemon set spec

- We can do that with e.g. `kubectl edit daemonset rng`

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## We've put resources in your resources

- Reminder: a daemon set is a resource that creates more resources!

- There is a difference between:

  - the label(s) of a resource (in the `metadata` block in the beginning)

  - the selector of a resource (in the `spec` block)

  - the label(s) of the resource(s) created by the first resource (in the `template` block)

- We would need to update the selector and the template

  (metadata labels are not mandatory)

- The template must match the selector

  (i.e. the resource will refuse to create resources that it will not select)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and debugging

- When a pod is misbehaving, we can delete it: another one will be recreated

- But we can also change its labels

- It will be removed from the load balancer (it won't receive traffic anymore)

- Another pod will be recreated immediately

- But the problematic pod is still here, and we can inspect and debug it

- We can even re-add it to the rotation if necessary

  (Very useful to troubleshoot intermittent and elusive bugs)

.debug[[k8s/daemonset.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/daemonset.md)]
---

## Labels and advanced rollout control

- Conversely, we can add pods matching a service's selector

- These pods will then receive requests and serve traffic

- Examples:

  - one-shot pod with all debug flags enabled, to collect logs

  - pods created automatically, but added to rotation in a second step
    <br/>
    (by setting their label accordingly)

- This gives us building blocks for canary and blue/green deployments

# Namespaces

- We would like to deploy another copy of DockerCoins on our cluster

- We could rename all our deployments and services:

  hasher → hasher2, redis → redis2, rng → rng2, etc.

- That would require updating the code

- There has to be a better way!

--

- As hinted by the title of this section, we will use *namespaces*

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Identifying a resource

- We cannot have two resources with the same name

  (or can we...?)

--

- We cannot have two resources *of the same kind* with the same name

  (but it's OK to have an `rng` service, an `rng` deployment, and an `rng` daemon set)

--

- We cannot have two resources of the same kind with the same name *in the same namespace*

  (but it's OK to have e.g. two `rng` services in different namespaces)

--

- Except for resources that exist at the *cluster scope*

  (these do not belong to a namespace)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Uniquely identifying a resource

- For *namespaced* resources:

  the tuple *(kind, name, namespace)* needs to be unique

- For resources at the *cluster scope*:

  the tuple *(kind, name)* needs to be unique

.exercise[

- List resource types again, and check the NAMESPACED column:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Pre-existing namespaces

- If we deploy a cluster with `kubeadm`, we have three or four namespaces:

  - `default` (for our applications)

  - `kube-system` (for the control plane)

  - `kube-public` (contains one ConfigMap for cluster discovery)

  - `kube-node-lease` (in Kubernetes 1.14 and later; contains Lease objects)

- If we deploy differently, we may have different namespaces

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Creating namespaces

- Let's see two identical methods to create a namespace

.exercise[

- We can use `kubectl create namespace`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace blue
  ```

- Or we can construct a very minimal YAML snippet:
  ```bash
	kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Namespace
	metadata:
	  name: blue
	EOF
  ```

]

- Some tools like Helm will create namespaces automatically when needed

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using namespaces

- We can pass a `-n` or `--namespace` flag to most `kubectl` commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n blue get svc
  ```

- We can also change our current *context*

- A context is a *(user, cluster, namespace)* tuple

- We can manipulate contexts with the `kubectl config` command

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing existing contexts

- On our training environments, at this point, there should be only one context

.exercise[

- View existing contexts to see the cluster name and the current user:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

- The current context (the only one!) is tagged with a `*`

- What are NAME, CLUSTER, AUTHINFO, and NAMESPACE?

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## What's in a context

- NAME is an arbitrary string to identify the context

- CLUSTER is a reference to a cluster

  (i.e. API endpoint URL, and optional certificate)

- AUTHINFO is a reference to the authentication information to use

  (i.e. a TLS client certificate, token, or otherwise)

- NAMESPACE is the namespace

  (empty string = `default`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching contexts

- We want to use a different namespace

- Solution 1: update the current context

  *This is appropriate if we need to change just one thing (e.g. namespace or authentication).*

- Solution 2: create a new context and switch to it

  *This is appropriate if we need to change multiple things and switch back and forth.*

- Let's go with solution 1!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Updating a context

- This is done through `kubectl config set-context`

- We can update a context by passing its name, or the current context with `--current`

.exercise[

- Update the current context to use the `blue` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=blue
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Using our new namespace

- Let's check that we are in our new namespace, then deploy a new copy of Dockercoins

.exercise[

- Verify that the new context is empty:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Deploying DockerCoins with YAML files

- The GitHub repository `jpetazzo/kubercoins` contains everything we need!

.exercise[

- Clone the kubercoins repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

- Create all the DockerCoins resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f kubercoins
  ```

]

If the argument behind `-f` is a directory, all the files in that directory are processed. 

The subdirectories are *not* processed, unless we also add the `-R` flag.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Viewing the deployed app

- Let's see if this worked correctly!

.exercise[

- Retrieve the port number allocated to the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc webui
  ```

- Point our browser to http://X.X.X.X:3xxxx

]

If the graph shows up but stays at zero, give it a minute or two!

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Namespaces and isolation

- Namespaces *do not* provide isolation

- A pod in the `green` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `blue` namespace

- A pod in the `default` namespace can communicate with a pod in the `kube-system` namespace

- CoreDNS uses a different subdomain for each namespace

- Example: from any pod in the cluster, you can connect to the Kubernetes API with:

  `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443/`

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Isolating pods

- Actual isolation is implemented with *network policies*

- Network policies are resources (like deployments, services, namespaces...)

- Network policies specify which flows are allowed:

  - between pods

  - from pods to the outside world

  - and vice-versa

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switch back to the default namespace

- Let's make sure that we don't run future exercises in the `blue` namespace

.exercise[

- Switch back to the original context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=
  ```

]

Note: we could have used `--namespace=default` for the same result.

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## Switching namespaces more easily

- We can also use a little helper tool called `kubens`:

  ```bash
  # Switch to namespace foo
  kubens foo
  # Switch back to the previous namespace
  kubens -
  ```

- On our clusters, `kubens` is called `kns` instead

  (so that it's even fewer keystrokes to switch namespaces)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

##  `kubens` and `kubectx`

- With `kubens`, we can switch quickly between namespaces

- With `kubectx`, we can switch quickly between contexts

- Both tools are simple shell scripts available from https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx

- On our clusters, they are installed as `kns` and `kctx`

  (for brevity and to avoid completion clashes between `kubectx` and `kubectl`)

.debug[[k8s/namespaces.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/namespaces.md)]
---

## `kube-ps1`

- It's easy to lose track of our current cluster / context / namespace

- `kube-ps1` makes it easy to track these, by showing them in our shell prompt

- It's a simple shell script available from https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1

- On our clusters, `kube-ps1` is installed and included in `PS1`:
  ```
  [123.45.67.89] `(kubernetes-admin@kubernetes:default)` docker@node1 ~
  ```
  (The highlighted part is `context:namespace`, managed by `kube-ps1`)

- Highly recommended if you work across multiple contexts or namespaces!

# Rolling updates

- By default (without rolling updates), when a scaled resource is updated:

  - new pods are created

  - old pods are terminated

  - ... all at the same time

  - if something goes wrong, ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates

- With rolling updates, when a resource is updated, it happens progressively

- Two parameters determine the pace of the rollout: `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge`

- They can be specified in absolute number of pods, or percentage of the `replicas` count

- At any given time ...

  - there will always be at least `replicas`-`maxUnavailable` pods available

  - there will never be more than `replicas`+`maxSurge` pods in total

  - there will therefore be up to `maxUnavailable`+`maxSurge` pods being updated

- We have the possibility of rolling back to the previous version
  <br/>(if the update fails or is unsatisfactory in any way)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Checking current rollout parameters

- Recall how we build custom reports with `kubectl` and `jq`:

.exercise[

- Show the rollout plan for our deployments:
  ```bash
    kubectl get deploy -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling updates in practice

- As of Kubernetes 1.8, we can do rolling updates with:

  `deployments`, `daemonsets`, `statefulsets`

- Editing one of these resources will automatically result in a rolling update

- Rolling updates can be monitored with the `kubectl rollout` subcommand

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]

## Building a new version of the `worker` service

.warning[
Only run these commands if you have built and pushed DockerCoins to a local registry.
<br/>
If you are using images from the Docker Hub (`dockercoins/worker:v0.1`), skip this.
]

.exercise[

- Go to the `stacks` directory (`~/container.training/stacks`)

- Edit `dockercoins/worker/worker.py`; update the first `sleep` line to sleep 1 second

- Build a new tag and push it to the registry:
  ```bash
  #export REGISTRY=localhost:3xxxx
  export TAG=v0.2
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml build
  docker-compose -f dockercoins.yml push
  ```

]

## Rolling out the new `worker` service

.exercise[

- Let's monitor what's going on by opening a few terminals, and run:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  kubectl get replicasets -w
  kubectl get deployments -w
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Update `worker` either with `kubectl edit`, or by running:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

]

--

That rollout should be pretty quick. What shows in the web UI?

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Give it some time

- At first, it looks like nothing is happening (the graph remains at the same level)

- According to `kubectl get deploy -w`, the `deployment` was updated really quickly

- But `kubectl get pods -w` tells a different story

- The old `pods` are still here, and they stay in `Terminating` state for a while

- Eventually, they are terminated; and then the graph decreases significantly

- This delay is due to the fact that our worker doesn't handle signals

- Kubernetes sends a "polite" shutdown request to the worker, which ignores it

- After a grace period, Kubernetes gets impatient and kills the container

  (The grace period is 30 seconds, but [can be changed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#termination-of-pods) if needed)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## Rolling out something invalid

- What happens if we make a mistake?

.exercise[

- Update `worker` by specifying a non-existent image:
  ```bash
  export TAG=v0.3
  kubectl set image deploy worker worker=$REGISTRY/worker:$TAG
  ```

- Check what's going on:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

<!--
```wait Waiting for deployment```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

Our rollout is stuck. However, the app is not dead.

(After a minute, it will stabilize to be 20-25% slower.)

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]
---

## What's going on with our rollout?

- Why is our app a bit slower?

- Because `MaxUnavailable=25%`

  ... So the rollout terminated 2 replicas out of 10 available

- Okay, but why do we see 5 new replicas being rolled out?

- Because `MaxSurge=25%`

  ... So in addition to replacing 2 replicas, the rollout is also starting 3 more

- It rounded down the number of MaxUnavailable pods conservatively,
  <br/>
  but the total number of pods being rolled out is allowed to be 25+25=50%

.debug[[k8s/rollout.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/rollout.md)]

class: extra-details

## The nitty-gritty details

- We start with 10 pods running for the `worker` deployment

- Current settings: MaxUnavailable=25% and MaxSurge=25%

- When we start the rollout:

  - two replicas are taken down (as per MaxUnavailable=25%)
  - two others are created (with the new version) to replace them
  - three others are created (with the new version) per MaxSurge=25%)

- Now we have 8 replicas up and running, and 5 being deployed

- Our rollout is stuck at this point!

## Checking the dashboard during the bad rollout

If you didn't deploy the Kubernetes dashboard earlier, just skip this slide.

.exercise[

- Check which port the dashboard is on:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system get svc socat
  ```

]

Note the `3xxxx` port.

.exercise[

- Connect to http://oneofournodes:3xxxx/

<!-- ```open https://node1:3xxxx/``` -->

]

--

- We have failures in Deployments, Pods, and Replica Sets

---

## Recovering from a bad rollout

- We could push some `v0.3` image

  (the pod retry logic will eventually catch it and the rollout will proceed)

- Or we could invoke a manual rollback

.exercise[

<!--
```keys
^C
```
-->

- Cancel the deployment and wait for the dust to settle:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout undo deploy worker
  kubectl rollout status deploy worker
  ```

]

---

class: extra-details

## Changing rollout parameters

- We want to:

  - revert to `v0.1`
  - be conservative on availability (always have desired number of available workers)
  - go slow on rollout speed (update only one pod at a time) 
  - give some time to our workers to "warm up" before starting more

The corresponding changes can be expressed in the following YAML snippet:

.small[
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: worker
        image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  minReadySeconds: 10
```
]

---

class: extra-details

## Applying changes through a YAML patch

- We could use `kubectl edit deployment worker`

- But we could also use `kubectl patch` with the exact YAML shown before

.exercise[

.small[

- Apply all our changes and wait for them to take effect:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch deployment worker -p "
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: $REGISTRY/worker:v0.1
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 0
          maxSurge: 1
      minReadySeconds: 10
    "
  kubectl rollout status deployment worker
  kubectl get deploy -o json worker |
          jq "{name:.metadata.name} + .spec.strategy.rollingUpdate"

# Recording deployment actions

- Some commands that modify a Deployment accept an optional `--record` flag

  (Example: `kubectl set image deployment worker worker=alpine --record`)

- That flag will store the command line in the Deployment

  (Technically, using the annotation `kubernetes.io/change-cause`)

- It gets copied to the corresponding ReplicaSet

  (Allowing to keep track of which command created or promoted this ReplicaSet)

- We can view this information with `kubectl rollout history`

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Using `--record`

- Let's make a couple of changes to a Deployment and record them

.exercise[

- Roll back `worker` to image version 0.1:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.1 --record
  ```

- Promote it to version 0.2 again:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.2 --record
  ```

- View the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Pitfall #1: forgetting `--record`

- What happens if we don't specify `--record`?

.exercise[

- Promote `worker` to image version 0.3:
  ```bash
  kubectl set image deployment worker worker=dockercoins/worker:v0.3
  ```

- View the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

It recorded version 0.2 instead of 0.3! Why?

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## How `--record` really works

- `kubectl` adds the annotation `kubernetes.io/change-cause` to the Deployment

- The Deployment controller copies that annotation to the ReplicaSet

- `kubectl rollout history` shows the ReplicaSets' annotations

- If we don't specify `--record`, the annotation is not updated

- The previous value of that annotation is copied to the new ReplicaSet

- In that case, the ReplicaSet annotation does not reflect reality!

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Pitfall #2: recording `scale` commands

- What happens if we use `kubectl scale --record`?

.exercise[

- Check the current history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

- Scale the deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment worker --replicas=3 --record
  ```

- Check the change history again:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

The last entry in the history was overwritten by the `scale` command! Why?

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Actions that don't create a new ReplicaSet

- The `scale` command updates the Deployment definition

- But it doesn't create a new ReplicaSet

- Using the `--record` flag sets the annotation like before

- The annotation gets copied to the existing ReplicaSet

- This overwrites the previous annotation that was there

- In that case, we lose the previous change cause!

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Updating the annotation directly

- Let's see what happens if we set the annotation manually

.exercise[

- Annotate the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate deployment worker kubernetes.io/change-cause="Just for fun"
  ```

- Check that our annotation shows up in the change history:
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout history deployment worker
  ```

]

--

Our annotation shows up (and overwrote whatever was there before).

.debug[[k8s/record.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/record.md)]
---

## Using change cause

- It sounds like a good idea to use `--record`, but:

  *"Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation."*
  <br/>
  (Bertrand Meyer)

- If we use `--record` once, we need to either:

  - use it every single time after that

  - or clear the Deployment annotation after using `--record`
    <br/>
    (subsequent changes will show up with a `<none>` change cause)

- A safer way is to set it through our tooling

# Healthchecks

- Kubernetes provides two kinds of healthchecks: liveness and readiness

- Healthchecks are *probes* that apply to *containers* (not to pods)

- Each container can have two (optional) probes:

  - liveness = is this container dead or alive?

  - readiness = is this container ready to serve traffic?

- Different probes are available (HTTP, TCP, program execution)

- Let's see the difference and how to use them!

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Liveness probe

- Indicates if the container is dead or alive

- A dead container cannot come back to life

- If the liveness probe fails, the container is killed

  (to make really sure that it's really dead; no zombies or undeads!)

- What happens next depends on the pod's `restartPolicy`:

  - `Never`: the container is not restarted

  - `OnFailure` or `Always`: the container is restarted

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a liveness probe

- To indicate failures that can't be recovered

  - deadlocks (causing all requests to time out)

  - internal corruption (causing all requests to error)

- If the liveness probe fails *N* consecutive times, the container is killed

- *N* is the `failureThreshold` (3 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Readiness probe

- Indicates if the container is ready to serve traffic

- If a container becomes "unready" (let's say busy!) it might be ready again soon

- If the readiness probe fails:

  - the container is *not* killed

  - if the pod is a member of a service, it is temporarily removed

  - it is re-added as soon as the readiness probe passes again

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## When to use a readiness probe

- To indicate temporary failures

  - the application can only service *N* parallel connections

  - the runtime is busy doing garbage collection or initial data load

- The container is marked as "not ready" after `failureThreshold` failed attempts

  (3 by default)

- It is marked again as "ready" after `successThreshold` successful attempts

  (1 by default)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Different types of probes

- HTTP request

  - specify URL of the request (and optional headers)

  - any status code between 200 and 399 indicates success

- TCP connection

  - the probe succeeds if the TCP port is open

- arbitrary exec

  - a command is executed in the container

  - exit status of zero indicates success

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Benefits of using probes

- Rolling updates proceed when containers are *actually ready*

  (as opposed to merely started)

- Containers in a broken state get killed and restarted

  (instead of serving errors or timeouts)

- Overloaded backends get removed from load balancer rotation

  (thus improving response times across the board)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: HTTP probe

Here is a pod template for the `rng` web service of the DockerCoins app:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rng-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: rng
    image: dockercoins/rng:v0.1
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 1
```

If the backend serves an error, or takes longer than 1s, 3 times in a row, it gets killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Example: exec probe

Here is a pod template for a Redis server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis-with-liveness
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command: ["redis-cli", "ping"]
```

If the Redis process becomes unresponsive, it will be killed.

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---

## Details about liveness and readiness probes

- Probes are executed at intervals of `periodSeconds` (default: 10)

- The timeout for a probe is set with `timeoutSeconds` (default: 1)

- A probe is considered successful after `successThreshold` successes (default: 1)

- A probe is considered failing after `failureThreshold` failures (default: 3)

- If a probe is not defined, it's as if there was an "always successful" probe

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks.md)]
---
## Questions to ask before adding healthchecks

- Do we want liveness, readiness, both?

  (sometimes, we can use the same check, but with different failure thresholds)

- Do we have existing HTTP endpoints that we can use?

- Do we need to add new endpoints, or perhaps use something else?

- Are our healthchecks likely to use resources and/or slow down the app?

- Do they depend on additional services?

  (this can be particularly tricky, see next slide)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Healthchecks and dependencies

- A good healthcheck should always indicate the health of the service itself

- It should not be affected by the state of the service's dependencies

- Example: a web server requiring a database connection to operate

  (make sure that the healthcheck can report "OK" even if the database is down;
  <br/>
  because it won't help us to restart the web server if the issue is with the DB!)

- Example: a microservice calling other microservices

- Example: a worker process

  (these will generally require minor code changes to report health)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Adding healthchecks to an app

- Let's add healthchecks to DockerCoins!

- We will examine the questions of the previous slide

- Then we will review each component individually to add healthchecks

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Liveness, readiness, or both?

- To answer that question, we need to see the app run for a while

- Do we get temporary, recoverable glitches?

  → then use readiness

- Or do we get hard lock-ups requiring a restart?

  → then use liveness

- In the case of DockerCoins, we don't know yet!

- Let's pick liveness

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Do we have HTTP endpoints that we can use?

- Each of the 3 web services (hasher, rng, webui) has a trivial route on `/`

- These routes:

  - don't seem to perform anything complex or expensive

  - don't seem to call other services

- Perfect!

  (See next slides for individual details)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

- [hasher.rb](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/hasher/hasher.rb)
  ```ruby
    get '/' do
      "HASHER running on #{Socket.gethostname}\n"
    end
  ```

- [rng.py](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/rng/rng.py)
  ```python
    @app.route("/")
    def index():
      return "RNG running on {}\n".format(hostname)
  ```

- [webui.js](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/dockercoins/webui/webui.js)
  ```javascript
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.redirect('/index.html');
    });
  ```

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Running DockerCoins

- We will run DockerCoins in a new, separate namespace

- We will use a set of YAML manifests and pre-built images

- We will add our new liveness probe to the YAML of the `rng` DaemonSet

- Then, we will deploy the application

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Creating a new namespace

- This will make sure that we don't collide / conflict with previous exercises

.exercise[

- Create the yellow namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace yellow
  ```

- Switch to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns yellow
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Retrieving DockerCoins manifests

- All the manifests that we need are on a convenient repository:

  https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins

.exercise[

- Clone that repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/kubercoins
  ```

- Change directory to the repository:
  ```bash
  cd kubercoins
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## A simple HTTP liveness probe

This is what our liveness probe should look like:

```yaml
containers:
- name: ...
image: ...
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 5
```

This will give 30 seconds to the service to start. (Way more than necessary!)
<br/>
It will run the probe every 5 seconds.
<br/>
It will use the default timeout (1 second).
<br/>
It will use the default failure threshold (3 failed attempts = dead).
<br/>
It will use the default success threshold (1 successful attempt = alive).

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Adding the liveness probe

- Let's add the liveness probe, then deploy DockerCoins

.exercise[

- Edit `rng-daemonset.yaml` and add the liveness probe
  ```bash
  vim rng-daemonset.yaml
  ```

- Load the YAML for all the resources of DockerCoins:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Testing the liveness probe

- The rng service needs 100ms to process a request

  (because it is single-threaded and sleeps 0.1s in each request)

- The probe timeout is set to 1 second

- If we send more than 10 requests per second per backend, it will break

- Let's generate traffic and see what happens!

.exercise[

- Get the ClusterIP address of the rng service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc rng
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Monitoring the rng service

- Each command below will show us what's happening on a different level

.exercise[

- In one window, monitor cluster events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events -w
  ```

- In another window, monitor the response time of rng:
  ```bash
  httping `<ClusterIP>`
  ```

- In another window, monitor pods status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Generating traffic

- Let's use `ab` to send concurrent requests to rng

.exercise[

- In yet another window, generate traffic:
  ```bash
  ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://`<ClusterIP>`/1
  ```

- Experiment with higher values of `-c` and see what happens

]

- The `-c` parameter indicates the number of concurrent requests

- The final `/1` is important to generate actual traffic

  (otherwise we would use the ping endpoint, which doesn't sleep 0.1s per request)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Discussion

- Above a given threshold, the liveness probe starts failing

  (about 10 concurrent requests per backend should be plenty enough)

- When the liveness probe fails 3 times in a row, the container is restarted

- During the restart, there is *less* capacity available

- ... Meaning that the other backends are likely to timeout as well

- ... Eventually causing all backends to be restarted

- ... And each fresh backend gets restarted, too

- This goes on until the load goes down, or we add capacity

*This wouldn't be a good healthcheck in a real application!*

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Better healthchecks

- We need to make sure that the healthcheck doesn't trip when
  performance degrades due to external pressure

- Using a readiness check would have fewer effects

  (but it would still be an imperfect solution)

- A possible combination:

  - readiness check with a short timeout / low failure threshold

  - liveness check with a longer timeout / higher failure threshold

## Healthchecks for redis

- A liveness probe is enough

  (it's not useful to remove a backend from rotation when it's the only one)

- We could use an exec probe running `redis-cli ping`

class: extra-details

## Exec probes and zombies

- When using exec probes, we should make sure that we have a *zombie reaper*

  🤔🧐🧟 Wait, what?

- When a process terminates, its parent must call `wait()`/`waitpid()`

  (this is how the parent process retrieves the child's exit status)

- In the meantime, the process is in *zombie* state

  (the process state will show as `Z` in `ps`, `top` ...)

- When a process is killed, its children are *orphaned* and attached to PID 1

- PID 1 has the responsibility of *reaping* these processes when they terminate

- OK, but how does that affect us?

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## PID 1 in containers

- On ordinary systems, PID 1 (`/sbin/init`) has logic to reap processes

- In containers, PID 1 is typically our application process

  (e.g. Apache, the JVM, NGINX, Redis ...)

- These *do not* take care of reaping orphans

- If we use exec probes, we need to add a process reaper

- We can add [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) to our images

- Or [share the PID namespace between containers of a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/)

  (and have gcr.io/pause take care of the reaping)

.debug[[k8s/healthchecks-more.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/healthchecks-more.md)]
---

## Healthchecks for worker

- Readiness isn't useful

  (because worker isn't a backend for a service)

- Liveness may help us restart a broken worker, but how can we check it?

- Embedding an HTTP server is an option

  (but it has a high potential for unwanted side effects and false positives)

- Using a "lease" file can be relatively easy:

  - touch a file during each iteration of the main loop

  - check the timestamp of that file from an exec probe

- Writing logs (and checking them from the probe) also works

# Network policies

- Namespaces help us to *organize* resources

- Namespaces do not provide isolation

- By default, every pod can contact every other pod

- By default, every service accepts traffic from anyone

- If we want this to be different, we need *network policies*

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## What's a network policy?

A network policy is defined by the following things.

- A *pod selector* indicating which pods it applies to

  e.g.: "all pods in namespace `blue` with the label `zone=internal`"

- A list of *ingress rules* indicating which inbound traffic is allowed

  e.g.: "TCP connections to ports 8000 and 8080 coming from pods with label `zone=dmz`,
  and from the external subnet 4.42.6.0/24, except 4.42.6.5"

- A list of *egress rules* indicating which outbound traffic is allowed

A network policy can provide ingress rules, egress rules, or both.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## How do network policies apply?

- A pod can be "selected" by any number of network policies

- If a pod isn't selected by any network policy, then its traffic is unrestricted

  (In other words: in the absence of network policies, all traffic is allowed)

- If a pod is selected by at least one network policy, then all traffic is blocked ...

  ... unless it is explicitly allowed by one of these network policies

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Traffic filtering is flow-oriented

- Network policies deal with *connections*, not individual packets

- Example: to allow HTTP (80/tcp) connections to pod A, you only need an ingress rule

  (You do not need a matching egress rule to allow response traffic to go through)

- This also applies for UDP traffic

  (Allowing DNS traffic can be done with a single rule)

- Network policy implementations use stateful connection tracking

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Pod-to-pod traffic

- Connections from pod A to pod B have to be allowed by both pods:

  - pod A has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *egress* rule

  - pod B has to be unrestricted, or allow the connection as an *ingress* rule

- As a consequence: if a network policy restricts traffic going from/to a pod,
  <br/>
  the restriction cannot be overridden by a network policy selecting another pod

- This prevents an entity managing network policies in namespace A
  (but without permission to do so in namespace B)
  from adding network policies giving them access to namespace B

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## The rationale for network policies

- In network security, it is generally considered better to "deny all, then allow selectively"

  (The other approach, "allow all, then block selectively" makes it too easy to leave holes)

- As soon as one network policy selects a pod, the pod enters this "deny all" logic

- Further network policies can open additional access

- Good network policies should be scoped as precisely as possible

- In particular: make sure that the selector is not too broad

  (Otherwise, you end up affecting pods that were otherwise well secured)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Our first network policy

This is our game plan:

- run a web server in a pod

- create a network policy to block all access to the web server

- create another network policy to allow access only from specific pods

  kubectl create deployment testweb --image=nginx
  ```

- Find out the IP address of the pod with one of these two commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -l app=testweb
  IP=$(kubectl get pods -l app=testweb -o json | jq -r .items[0].status.podIP)
  ```

- Check that we can connect to the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```
]

The `curl` command should show us the "Welcome to nginx!" page.

## Adding a very restrictive network policy

- The policy will select pods with the label `app=testweb`

- It will specify an empty list of ingress rules (matching nothing)

.exercise[

- Apply the policy in this YAML file:
  ```bash
    kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-deny-all-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

- Check if we can still access the server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

]

The `curl` command should now time out.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-all-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing connections only from specific pods

- We want to allow traffic from pods with the label `run=testcurl`

- Reminder: this label is automatically applied when we do `kubectl run testcurl ...`

.exercise[

- Apply another policy:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-allow-testcurl-for-testweb.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Looking at the network policy

This is the second file that we applied:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-testcurl-for-testweb
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: testweb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: testcurl
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Testing the network policy

- Let's create pods with, and without, the required label

.exercise[

- Try to connect to testweb from a pod with the `run=testcurl` label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testcurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

- Try to connect to testweb with a different label:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testkurl --rm -i --image=centos -- curl -m3 $IP
  ```

]

The first command will work (and show the "Welcome to nginx!" page).

The second command will fail and time out after 3 seconds.

(The timeout is obtained with the `-m3` option.)

## An important warning

- Some network plugins only have partial support for network policies

- For instance, Weave added support for egress rules [in version 2.4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3313) (released in July 2018)

- But only recently added support for ipBlock [in version 2.5](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3367) (released in Nov 2018)

- Unsupported features might be silently ignored

  (Making you believe that you are secure, when you're not)

## Network policies, pods, and services

- Network policies apply to *pods*

- A *service* can select multiple pods

  (And load balance traffic across them)

- It is possible that we can connect to some pods, but not some others

  (Because of how network policies have been defined for these pods)

- In that case, connections to the service will randomly pass or fail

  (Depending on whether the connection was sent to a pod that we have access to or not)

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies and namespaces

- A good strategy is to isolate a namespace, so that:

  - all the pods in the namespace can communicate together

  - other namespaces cannot access the pods

  - external access has to be enabled explicitly

- Let's see what this would look like for the DockerCoins app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Network policies for DockerCoins

- We are going to apply two policies

- The first policy will prevent traffic from other namespaces

- The second policy will allow traffic to the `webui` pods

- That's all we need for that app!

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Blocking traffic from other namespaces

This policy selects all pods in the current namespace.

It allows traffic only from pods in the current namespace.

(An empty `podSelector` means "all pods.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-from-other-namespaces
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Allowing traffic to `webui` pods

This policy selects all pods with label `app=webui`.

It allows traffic from any source.

(An empty `from` field means "all sources.")

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-webui
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webui
  ingress:
  - from: []
```

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Applying both network policies

- Both network policies are declared in the file `k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml`

.exercise[

- Apply the network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/netpol-dockercoins.yaml
  ```

- Check that we can still access the web UI from outside
  <br/>
  (and that the app is still working correctly!)

- Check that we can't connect anymore to `rng` or `hasher` through their ClusterIP

]

Note: using `kubectl proxy` or `kubectl port-forward` allows us to connect
regardless of existing network policies. This allows us to debug and
troubleshoot easily, without having to poke holes in our firewall.

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Cleaning up our network policies

- The network policies that we have installed block all traffic to the default namespace

- We should remove them, otherwise further exercises will fail!

.exercise[

- Remove all network policies:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete networkpolicies --all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Protecting the control plane

- Should we add network policies to block unauthorized access to the control plane?

  (etcd, API server, etc.)

--

- At first, it seems like a good idea ...

--

- But it *shouldn't* be necessary:

  - not all network plugins support network policies

  - the control plane is secured by other methods (mutual TLS, mostly)

  - the code running in our pods can reasonably expect to contact the API
    <br/>
    (and it can do so safely thanks to the API permission model)

- If we block access to the control plane, we might disrupt legitimate code

- ...Without necessarily improving security

.debug[[k8s/netpol.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/netpol.md)]
---

## Further resources

- As always, the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is a good starting point

- The API documentation has a lot of detail about the format of various objects:

  - [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicy-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicySpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyspec-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - [NetworkPolicyIngressRule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.12/#networkpolicyingressrule-v1-networking-k8s-io)

  - etc.

- And two resources by [Ahmet Alp Balkan](https://ahmet.im/):

  - a [very good talk about network policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLj6h78yzYM2P-3-xqvmWaZbbI1sW-ulZb&v=3gGpMmYeEO8) at KubeCon North America 2017

  - a repository of [ready-to-use recipes](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes) for network policies

# Accessing the API with `kubectl proxy`

- The API requires us to authenticate.red[¹]

- There are many authentication methods available, including:

  - TLS client certificates
    <br/>
    (that's what we've used so far)

  - HTTP basic password authentication
    <br/>
    (from a static file; not recommended)

  - various token mechanisms
    <br/>
    (detailed in the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies))

.red[¹]OK, we lied. If you don't authenticate, you are considered to
be user `system:anonymous`, which doesn't have any access rights by default.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Accessing the API directly

- Let's see what happens if we try to access the API directly with `curl`

.exercise[

- Retrieve the ClusterIP allocated to the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  ```

- Replace the IP below and try to connect with `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`/
  ```

]

The API will tell us that user `system:anonymous` cannot access this path.

---

## Authenticating to the API

If we wanted to talk to the API, we would need to:

- extract our TLS key and certificate information from `~/.kube/config`

  (the information is in PEM format, encoded in base64)

- use that information to present our certificate when connecting

  (for instance, with `openssl s_client -key ... -cert ... -connect ...`)

- figure out exactly which credentials to use

  (once we start juggling multiple clusters)

- change that whole process if we're using another authentication method

🤔 There has to be a better way!

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Using `kubectl proxy` for authentication

- `kubectl proxy` runs a proxy in the foreground

- This proxy lets us access the Kubernetes API without authentication

  (`kubectl proxy` adds our credentials on the fly to the requests)

- This proxy lets us access the Kubernetes API over plain HTTP

- This is a great tool to learn and experiment with the Kubernetes API

- ... And for serious uses as well (suitable for one-shot scripts)

- For unattended use, it's better to create a [service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Trying `kubectl proxy`

- Let's start `kubectl proxy` and then do a simple request with `curl`!

.exercise[

- Start `kubectl proxy` in the background:
  ```bash
  kubectl proxy &
  ```

- Access the API's default route:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001
  ```

<!--
```wait /version```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Terminate the proxy:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

]

The output is a list of available API routes.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` is intended for local use

- By default, the proxy listens on port 8001

  (But this can be changed, or we can tell `kubectl proxy` to pick a port)

- By default, the proxy binds to `127.0.0.1`

  (Making it unreachable from other machines, for security reasons)

- By default, the proxy only accepts connections from:

  `^localhost$,^127\.0\.0\.1$,^\[::1\]$`

- This is great when running `kubectl proxy` locally

- Not-so-great when you want to connect to the proxy from a remote machine

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Running `kubectl proxy` on a remote machine

- If we wanted to connect to the proxy from another machine, we would need to:

  - bind to `INADDR_ANY` instead of `127.0.0.1`

  - accept connections from any address

- This is achieved with:
  ```
  kubectl proxy --port=8888 --address=0.0.0.0 --accept-hosts=.*
  ```

.warning[Do not do this on a real cluster: it opens full unauthenticated access!]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Security considerations

- Running `kubectl proxy` openly is a huge security risk

- It is slightly better to run the proxy where you need it

  (and copy credentials, e.g. `~/.kube/config`, to that place)

- It is even better to use a limited account with reduced permissions

.debug[[k8s/kubectlproxy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/kubectlproxy.md)]
---

## Good to know ...

- `kubectl proxy` also gives access to all internal services

- Specifically, services are exposed as such:
  ```
  /api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy
  ```

- We can use `kubectl proxy` to access an internal service in a pinch

  (or, for non HTTP services, `kubectl port-forward`)

- This is not very useful when running `kubectl` directly on the cluster

  (since we could connect to the services directly anyway)

- But it is very powerful as soon as you run `kubectl` from a remote machine

# Controlling a Kubernetes cluster remotely

- `kubectl` can be used either on cluster instances or outside the cluster

- Here, we are going to use `kubectl` from our local machine

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Requirements

.warning[The exercises in this chapter should be done *on your local machine*.]

- `kubectl` is officially available on Linux, macOS, Windows

  (and unofficially anywhere we can build and run Go binaries)

- You may skip these exercises if you are following along from:

  - a tablet or phone

  - a web-based terminal

  - an environment where you can't install and run new binaries

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Installing `kubectl`

- If you already have `kubectl` on your local machine, you can skip this

.exercise[

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- Download the `kubectl` binary from one of these links:

  [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [macOS](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl)
  |
  [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe)

- On Linux and macOS, make the binary executable with `chmod +x kubectl`

  (And remember to run it with `./kubectl` or move it to your `$PATH`)

]

Note: if you are following along with a different platform (e.g. Linux on an architecture different from amd64, or with a phone or tablet), installing `kubectl` might be more complicated (or even impossible) so feel free to skip this section.

## Testing `kubectl`

- Check that `kubectl` works correctly

  (before even trying to connect to a remote cluster!)

.exercise[

- Ask `kubectl` to show its version number:
  ```bash
  kubectl version --client
  ```

]

The output should look like this:
```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.0",
GitCommit:"e8462b5b5dc2584fdcd18e6bcfe9f1e4d970a529", GitTreeState:"clean",
BuildDate:"2019-06-19T16:40:16Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc",
Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
```

---

## Preserving the existing `~/.kube/config`

- If you already have a `~/.kube/config` file, rename it

  (we are going to overwrite it in the following slides!)

- If you never used `kubectl` on your machine before: nothing to do!

.exercise[

- Make a copy of `~/.kube/config`; if you are using macOS or Linux, you can do:
  ```bash
  cp ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config.before.training
  ```

- If you are using Windows, you will need to adapt this command

]

---

## Copying the configuration file from `node1`

- The `~/.kube/config` file that is on `node1` contains all the credentials we need

- Let's copy it over!

.exercise[

- Copy the file from `node1`; if you are using macOS or Linux, you can do:
  ```
  scp `USER`@`X.X.X.X`:.kube/config ~/.kube/config
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1,
  # and USER with the user name used to log into node1!
  ```

- If you are using Windows, adapt these instructions to your SSH client

]

.debug[[k8s/localkubeconfig.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/localkubeconfig.md)]
---

## Updating the server address

- There is a good chance that we need to update the server address

- To know if it is necessary, run `kubectl config view`

- Look for the `server:` address:

  - if it matches the public IP address of `node1`, you're good!

  - if it is anything else (especially a private IP address), update it!

- To update the server address, run:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --server=https://`X.X.X.X`:6443
  # Make sure to replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of node1!
  ```

## What if we get a certificate error?

- Generally, the Kubernetes API uses a certificate that is valid for:

  - `kubernetes`
  - `kubernetes.default`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc`
  - `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`
  - the ClusterIP address of the `kubernetes` service
  - the hostname of the node hosting the control plane (e.g. `node1`)
  - the IP address of the node hosting the control plane

- On most clouds, the IP address of the node is an internal IP address

- ... And we are going to connect over the external IP address

- ... And that external IP address was not used when creating the certificate!

---

class: extra-details

## Working around the certificate error

- We need to tell `kubectl` to skip TLS verification

  (only do this with testing clusters, never in production!)

- The following command will do the trick:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-cluster kubernetes --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  ```

## Checking that we can connect to the cluster

- We can now run a couple of trivial commands to check that all is well

.exercise[

- Check the versions of the local client and remote server:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- View the nodes of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

We can now utilize the cluster exactly as if we're logged into a node, except that it's remote.

# Accessing internal services

- When we are logged in on a cluster node, we can access internal services

  (by virtue of the Kubernetes network model: all nodes can reach all pods and services)

- When we are accessing a remote cluster, things are different

  (generally, our local machine won't have access to the cluster's internal subnet)

- How can we temporarily access a service without exposing it to everyone?

--

- `kubectl proxy`: gives us access to the API, which includes a proxy for HTTP resources

- `kubectl port-forward`: allows forwarding of TCP ports to arbitrary pods, services, ...

## Suspension of disbelief

The exercises in this section assume that we have set up `kubectl` on our
local machine in order to access a remote cluster.

We will therefore show how to access services and pods of the remote cluster,
from our local machine.

You can also run these exercises directly on the cluster (if you haven't
installed and set up `kubectl` locally).

Running commands locally will be less useful
(since you could access services and pods directly),
but keep in mind that these commands will work anywhere as long as you have
installed and set up `kubectl` to communicate with your cluster.

## `kubectl proxy` in theory

- Running `kubectl proxy` gives us access to the entire Kubernetes API

- The API includes routes to proxy HTTP traffic

- These routes look like the following:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy`

- We just add the URI to the end of the request, for instance:

  `/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/<service>/proxy/index.html`

- We can access `services` and `pods` this way

.debug[[k8s/accessinternal.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/accessinternal.md)]
---

## `kubectl proxy` in practice

- Let's access the `webui` service through `kubectl proxy`

.exercise[

- Run an API proxy in the background:
  ```bash
  kubectl proxy &
  ```

- Access the `webui` service:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/webui/proxy/index.html
  ```

- Terminate the proxy:
  ```bash
  kill %1

## `kubectl port-forward` in theory

- What if we want to access a TCP service?

- We can use `kubectl port-forward` instead

- It will create a TCP relay to forward connections to a specific port

  (of a pod, service, deployment...)

- The syntax is:

  `kubectl port-forward service/name_of_service local_port:remote_port`

- If only one port number is specified, it is used for both local and remote ports

## `kubectl port-forward` in practice

- Let's access our remote Redis server

.exercise[

- Forward connections from local port 10000 to remote port 6379:
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/redis 10000:6379 &
  ```

- Connect to the Redis server:
  ```bash
  telnet localhost 10000
  ```

- Issue a few commands, e.g. `INFO server` then `QUIT`

<!--
```wait Connected to localhost```
```keys INFO server```
```keys ^J```
```keys QUIT```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Terminate the port forwarder:
  ```bash
  kill %1
  ```

# Authentication and authorization

*And first, a little refresher!*

- Authentication = verifying the identity of a person

  On a UNIX system, we can authenticate with login+password, SSH keys ...

- Authorization = listing what they are allowed to do

  On a UNIX system, this can include file permissions, sudoer entries ...

- Sometimes abbreviated as "authn" and "authz"

- In good modular systems, these things are decoupled

   (so we can e.g. change a password or SSH key without having to reset access rights)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication in Kubernetes

- When the API server receives a request, it tries to authenticate it

  (it examines headers, certificates... anything available)

- Many authentication methods are available and can be used simultaneously

  (we will see them on the next slide)

- It's the job of the authentication method to produce:

  - the user name
  - the user ID
  - a list of groups

- The API server doesn't interpret these; that'll be the job of *authorizers*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication methods

- TLS client certificates

  (that's what we've been doing with `kubectl` so far)

- Bearer tokens

  (a secret token in the HTTP headers of the request)

- [HTTP basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

  (carrying user and password in an HTTP header)

- Authentication proxy

  (sitting in front of the API and setting trusted headers)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Anonymous requests

- If any authentication method *rejects* a request, it's denied

  (`401 Unauthorized` HTTP code)

- If a request is neither rejected nor accepted by anyone, it's anonymous

  - the user name is `system:anonymous`

  - the list of groups is `[system:unauthenticated]`

- By default, the anonymous user can't do anything

  (that's what you get if you just `curl` the Kubernetes API)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with TLS certificates

- This is enabled in most Kubernetes deployments

- The user name is derived from the `CN` in the client certificates

- The groups are derived from the `O` fields in the client certificate

- From the point of view of the Kubernetes API, users do not exist

  (i.e. they are not stored in etcd or anywhere else)

- Users can be created (and added to groups) independently of the API

- The Kubernetes API can be set up to use your custom CA to validate client certs

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Viewing our admin certificate

- Let's inspect the certificate we've been using all this time!

.exercise[

- This command will show the `CN` and `O` fields for our certificate:
  ```bash
  kubectl config view \
          --raw \
          -o json \
          | jq -r .users[0].user[\"client-certificate-data\"] \
          | openssl base64 -d -A \
          | openssl x509 -text \
          | grep Subject:
  ```

]

Let's break down that command together! 😅

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Breaking down the command

- `kubectl config view` shows the Kubernetes user configuration
- `--raw` includes certificate information (which shows as REDACTED otherwise)
- `-o json` outputs the information in JSON format
- `| jq ...` extracts the field with the user certificate (in base64)
- `| openssl base64 -d -A` decodes the base64 format (now we have a PEM file)
- `| openssl x509 -text` parses the certificate and outputs it as plain text
- `| grep Subject:` shows us the line that interests us

→ We are user `kubernetes-admin`, in group `system:masters`.

(We will see later how and why this gives us the permissions that we have.)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## User certificates in practice

- The Kubernetes API server does not support certificate revocation

  (see issue [#18982](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18982))

- As a result, we don't have an easy way to terminate someone's access

  (if their key is compromised, or they leave the organization)

- Option 1: re-create a new CA and re-issue everyone's certificates 
  <br/>
  → Maybe OK if we only have a few users; no way otherwise

- Option 2: don't use groups; grant permissions to individual users
  <br/>
  → Inconvenient if we have many users and teams; error-prone

- Option 3: issue short-lived certificates (e.g. 24 hours) and renew them often
  <br/>
  → This can be facilitated by e.g. Vault or by the Kubernetes CSR API

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Authentication with tokens

- Tokens are passed as HTTP headers:

  `Authorization: Bearer and-then-here-comes-the-token`

- Tokens can be validated through a number of different methods:

  - static tokens hard-coded in a file on the API server

  - [bootstrap tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) (special case to create a cluster or join nodes)

  - [OpenID Connect tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) (to delegate authentication to compatible OAuth2 providers)

  - service accounts (these deserve more details, coming right up!)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Service accounts

- A service account is a user that exists in the Kubernetes API

  (it is visible with e.g. `kubectl get serviceaccounts`)

- Service accounts can therefore be created / updated dynamically

  (they don't require hand-editing a file and restarting the API server)

- A service account is associated with a set of secrets

  (the kind that you can view with `kubectl get secrets`)

- Service accounts are generally used to grant permissions to applications, services...

  (as opposed to humans)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Token authentication in practice

- We are going to list existing service accounts

- Then we will extract the token for a given service account

- And we will use that token to authenticate with the API

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Listing service accounts

.exercise[

- The resource name is `serviceaccount` or `sa` for short:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa
  ```

]

There should be just one service account in the default namespace: `default`.

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Finding the secret

.exercise[

- List the secrets for the `default` service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sa default -o yaml
  SECRET=$(kubectl get sa default -o json | jq -r .secrets[0].name)
  ```

]

It should be named `default-token-XXXXX`.

---

class: extra-details

## Extracting the token

- The token is stored in the secret, wrapped with base64 encoding

.exercise[

- View the secret:
  ```bash
  kubectl get secret $SECRET -o yaml
  ```

- Extract the token and decode it:
  ```bash
  TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET -o json \
          | jq -r .data.token | openssl base64 -d -A)
  ```

]

---

class: extra-details

## Using the token

- Let's send a request to the API, without and with the token

.exercise[

- Find the ClusterIP for the `kubernetes` service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc kubernetes
  API=$(kubectl get svc kubernetes -o json | jq -r .spec.clusterIP)
  ```

- Connect without the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://$API
  ```

- Connect with the token:
  ```bash
  curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://$API
  ```

]

---

class: extra-details

## Results

- In both cases, we will get a "Forbidden" error

- Without authentication, the user is `system:anonymous`

- With authentication, it is shown as `system:serviceaccount:default:default`

- The API "sees" us as a different user

- But neither user has any rights, so we can't do nothin'

- Let's change that!

---

## Authorization in Kubernetes

- There are multiple ways to grant permissions in Kubernetes, called [authorizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#authorization-modules):

  - [Node Authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) (used internally by kubelet; we can ignore it)

  - [Attribute-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/) (powerful but complex and static; ignore it too)

  - [Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/) (each API request is submitted to an external service for approval)

  - [Role-based access control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (associates permissions to users dynamically)

- The one we want is the last one, generally abbreviated as RBAC

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Role-based access control

- RBAC allows to specify fine-grained permissions

- Permissions are expressed as *rules*

- A rule is a combination of:

  - [verbs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/#determine-the-request-verb) like create, get, list, update, delete...

  - resources (as in "API resource," like pods, nodes, services...)

  - resource names (to specify e.g. one specific pod instead of all pods)

  - in some case, [subresources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-resources) (e.g. logs are subresources of pods)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## From rules to roles to rolebindings

- A *role* is an API object containing a list of *rules*

  Example: role "external-load-balancer-configurator" can:
  - [list, get] resources [endpoints, services, pods]
  - [update] resources [services]

- A *rolebinding* associates a role with a user

  Example: rolebinding "external-load-balancer-configurator":
  - associates user "external-load-balancer-configurator"
  - with role "external-load-balancer-configurator"

- Yes, there can be users, roles, and rolebindings with the same name

- It's a good idea for 1-1-1 bindings; not so much for 1-N ones

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Cluster-scope permissions

- API resources Role and RoleBinding are for objects within a namespace

- We can also define API resources ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

- These are a superset, allowing us to:

  - specify actions on cluster-wide objects (like nodes)

  - operate across all namespaces

- We can create Role and RoleBinding resources within a namespace

- ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding resources are global

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Pods and service accounts

- A pod can be associated with a service account

  - by default, it is associated with the `default` service account

  - as we saw earlier, this service account has no permissions anyway

- The associated token is exposed to the pod's filesystem

  (in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)

- Standard Kubernetes tooling (like `kubectl`) will look for it there

- So Kubernetes tools running in a pod will automatically use the service account

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## In practice

- We are going to create a service account

- We will use a default cluster role (`view`)

- We will bind together this role and this service account

- Then we will run a pod using that service account

- In this pod, we will install `kubectl` and check our permissions

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Creating a service account

- We will call the new service account `viewer`

  (note that nothing prevents us from calling it `view`, like the role)

.exercise[

- Create the new service account:
  ```bash
  kubectl create serviceaccount viewer
  ```

- List service accounts now:
  ```bash
  kubectl get serviceaccounts
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Binding a role to the service account

- Binding a role = creating a *rolebinding* object

- We will call that object `viewercanview`

  (but again, we could call it `view`)

.exercise[

- Create the new role binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl create rolebinding viewercanview \
          --clusterrole=view \
          --serviceaccount=default:viewer
  ```

]

It's important to note a couple of details in these flags...

---

## Roles vs Cluster Roles

- We used `--clusterrole=view`

- What would have happened if we had used `--role=view`?

  - we would have bound the role `view` from the local namespace
    <br/>(instead of the cluster role `view`)

  - the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - but later, our API requests would have been denied

- This is a deliberate design decision

  (we can reference roles that don't exist, and create/update them later)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Users vs Service Accounts

- We used `--serviceaccount=default:viewer`

- What would have happened if we had used `--user=default:viewer`?

  - we would have bound the role to a user instead of a service account

  - again, the command would have worked fine (no error)

  - ...but our API requests would have been denied later

- What's about the `default:` prefix?

  - that's the namespace of the service account

  - yes, it could be inferred from context, but... `kubectl` requires it

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing

- We will run an `alpine` pod and install `kubectl` there

.exercise[

- Run a one-time pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl run eyepod --rm -ti --restart=Never \
          --serviceaccount=viewer \
          --image alpine
  ```

- Install `curl`, then use it to install `kubectl`:
  ```bash
  apk add --no-cache curl
  URLBASE=https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release
  KUBEVER=$(curl -s $URLBASE/stable.txt)
  curl -LO $URLBASE/$KUBEVER/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
  chmod +x kubectl
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Running `kubectl` in the pod

- We'll try to use our `view` permissions, then to create an object

.exercise[

- Check that we can, indeed, view things:
  ```bash
  ./kubectl get all
  ```

- But that we can't create things:
  ```
  ./kubectl create deployment testrbac --image=nginx
  ```

- Exit the container with `exit` or `^D`

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

## Testing directly with `kubectl`

- We can also check for permission with `kubectl auth can-i`:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes
  kubectl auth can-i create pods
  kubectl auth can-i get pod/name-of-pod
  kubectl auth can-i get /url-fragment-of-api-request/
  kubectl auth can-i '*' services
  ```

- And we can check permissions on behalf of other users:
  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as some-user
  kubectl auth can-i list nodes \
          --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name-of-service-account>
  ```

## Where does this `view` role come from?

- Kubernetes defines a number of ClusterRoles intended to be bound to users

- `cluster-admin` can do *everything* (think `root` on UNIX)

- `admin` can do *almost everything* (except e.g. changing resource quotas and limits)

- `edit` is similar to `admin`, but cannot view or edit permissions

- `view` has read-only access to most resources, except permissions and secrets

*In many situations, these roles will be all you need.*

*You can also customize them!*

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Customizing the default roles

- If you need to *add* permissions to these default roles (or others),
  <br/>
  you can do it through the [ClusterRole Aggregation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles) mechanism

- This happens by creating a ClusterRole with the following labels:
  ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
        rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
  ```

- This ClusterRole permissions will be added to `admin`/`edit`/`view` respectively

- This is particulary useful when using CustomResourceDefinitions

  (since Kubernetes cannot guess which resources are sensitive and which ones aren't)

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]

class: extra-details

## Where do our permissions come from?

- When interacting with the Kubernetes API, we are using a client certificate

- We saw previously that this client certificate contained:

  `CN=kubernetes-admin` and `O=system:masters`

- Let's look for these in existing ClusterRoleBindings:
  ```bash
  kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml | 
    grep -e kubernetes-admin -e system:masters
  ```

  (`system:masters` should show up, but not `kubernetes-admin`.)

- Where does this match come from?

.debug[[k8s/authn-authz.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/authn-authz.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The `system:masters` group

- If we eyeball the output of `kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o yaml`, we'll find out!

- It is in the `cluster-admin` binding:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrolebinding cluster-admin
  ```

- This binding associates `system:masters` with the cluster role `cluster-admin`

- And the `cluster-admin` is, basically, `root`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe clusterrole cluster-admin
  ```

## Figuring out who can do what

- For auditing purposes, sometimes we want to know who can perform an action

- There is a proof-of-concept tool by Aqua Security which does exactly that:

  https://github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can

- This is one way to install it:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/go/bin golang \
         go get -v github.com/aquasecurity/kubectl-who-can
  ```

- This is one way to use it:
  ```bash
  kubectl-who-can create pods
  ```

# Securing the control plane

- Many components accept connections (and requests) from others:

  - API server

  - etcd

  - kubelet

- We must secure these connections:

  - to deny unauthorized requests

  - to prevent eavesdropping secrets, tokens, and other sensitive information

- Disabling authentication and/or authorization is **strongly discouraged**

  (but it's possible to do it, e.g. for learning / troubleshooting purposes)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Authentication and authorization

- Authentication (checking "who you are") is done with mutual TLS

 (both the client and the server need to hold a valid certificate)

- Authorization (checking "what you can do") is done in different ways

  - the API server implements a sophisticated permission logic (with RBAC)
  
  - some services will defer authorization to the API server (through webhooks)

  - some services require a certificate signed by a particular CA / sub-CA

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]

## In practice

- We will review the various communication channels in the control plane

- We will describe how they are secured

- When TLS certificates are used, we will indicate:

  - which CA signs them

  - what their subject (CN) should be, when applicable

- We will indicate how to configure security (client- and server-side)

---

## etcd peers

- Replication and coordination of etcd happens on a dedicated port

  (typically port 2380; the default port for normal client connections is 2379)

- Authentication uses TLS certificates with a separate sub-CA

  (otherwise, anyone with a Kubernetes client certificate could access etcd!)

- The etcd command line flags involved are:

   `--peer-client-cert-auth=true` to activate it

   `--peer-cert-file`, `--peer-key-file`, `--peer-trusted-ca-file`

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## etcd clients

- The only¹ thing that connects to etcd is the API server

- Authentication uses TLS certificates with a separate sub-CA

  (for the same reasons as for etcd inter-peer authentication)

- The etcd command line flags involved are:

  `--client-cert-auth=true` to activate it

  `--trusted-ca-file`, `--cert-file`, `--key-file`

- The API server command line flags involved are:

  `--etcd-cafile`, `--etcd-certfile`, `--etcd-keyfile`

.footnote[¹Technically, there is also the etcd healthcheck. Let's ignore it for now.]

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## API server clients

- The API server has a sophisticated authentication and authorization system

- For connections coming from other components of the control plane:

  - authentication uses certificates (trusting the certificates' subject or CN)

  - authorization uses whatever mechanism is enabled (most oftentimes, RBAC)

- The relevant API server flags are:

  `--client-ca-file`, `--tls-cert-file`, `--tls-private-key-file`

- Each component connecting to the API server takes a `--kubeconfig` flag

  (to specify a kubeconfig file containing the CA cert, client key, and client cert)

- Yes, that kubeconfig file follows the same format as our `~/.kube/config` file!

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Kubelet and API server

- Communication between kubelet and API server can be established both ways

- Kubelet → API server:

  - kubelet registers itself ("hi, I'm node42, do you have work for me?")

  - connection is kept open and re-established if it breaks

  - that's how the kubelet knows which pods to start/stop

- API server → kubelet:

  - used to retrieve logs, exec, attach to containers

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Kubelet → API server

- Kubelet is started with `--kubeconfig` with API server information

- The client certificate of the kubelet will typically have:

  `CN=system:node:<nodename>` and groups `O=system:nodes`

- Nothing special on the API server side

  (it will authenticate like any other client)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## API server → kubelet

- Kubelet is started with the flag `--client-ca-file`

  (typically using the same CA as the API server)

- API server will use a dedicated key pair when contacting kubelet

  (specified with `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key`)

- Authorization uses webhooks

  (enabled with `--authorization-mode=Webhook` on kubelet)

- The webhook server is the API server itself

  (the kubelet sends back a request to the API server to ask, "can this person do that?")

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Scheduler

- The scheduler connects to the API server like an ordinary client

- The certificate of the scheduler will have `CN=system:kube-scheduler`

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Controller manager

- The controller manager is also a normal client to the API server

- Its certificate will have `CN=system:kube-controller-manager`

- If we use the CSR API, the controller manager needs the CA cert and key

  (passed with flags `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file`)

- We usually want the controller manager to generate tokens for service accounts

- These tokens deserve some details (on the next slide!)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Service account tokens

- Each time we create a service account, the controller manager generates a token

- These tokens are JWT tokens, signed with a particular key

- These tokens are used for authentication with the API server

  (and therefore, the API server needs to be able to verify their integrity)

- This uses another keypair:

  - the private key (used for signature) is passed to the controller manager
    <br/>(using flags `--service-account-private-key-file` and `--root-ca-file`)

  - the public key (used for verification) is passed to the API server
    <br/>(using flag `--service-account-key-file`)

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## kube-proxy

- kube-proxy is "yet another API server client"

- In many clusters, it runs as a Daemon Set

- In that case, it will have its own Service Account and associated permissions

- It will authenticate using the token of that Service Account

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Webhooks

- We mentioned webhooks earlier; how does that really work?

- The Kubernetes API has special resource types to check permissions

- One of them is SubjectAccessReview

- To check if a particular user can do a particular action on a particular resource:

  - we prepare a SubjectAccessReview object

  - we send that object to the API server

  - the API server responds with allow/deny (and optional explanations)

- Using webhooks for authorization = sending SAR to authorize each request

.debug[[k8s/control-plane-auth.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/control-plane-auth.md)]
---

## Subject Access Review

Here is an example showing how to check if `jean.doe` can `get` some `pods` in `kube-system`:

```bash
kubectl -v9 create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: SubjectAccessReview
spec:
  user: jean.doe
  group:
  - foo
  - bar
  resourceAttributes:
    #group: blah.k8s.io
    namespace: kube-system
    resource: pods
    verb: get
    #name: web-xyz1234567-pqr89
EOF
```

# Pod Security Policies

- By default, our pods and containers can do *everything*

  (including taking over the entire cluster)

- We are going to show an example of a malicious pod

- Then we will explain how to avoid this with PodSecurityPolicies

- We will enable PodSecurityPolicies on our cluster

- We will create a couple of policies (restricted and permissive)

- Finally we will see how to use them to improve security on our cluster

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Setting up a namespace

- For simplicity, let's work in a separate namespace

- Let's create a new namespace called "green"

.exercise[

- Create the "green" namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace green
  ```

- Change to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns green
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Creating a basic Deployment

- Just to check that everything works correctly, deploy NGINX

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment using the official NGINX image:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

- Confirm that the Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod exist, and that the Pod is running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## One example of malicious pods

- We will now show an escalation technique in action

- We will deploy a DaemonSet that adds our SSH key to the root account

  (on *each* node of the cluster)

- The Pods of the DaemonSet will do so by mounting `/root` from the host

.exercise[

- Check the file `k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml` with a text editor:
  ```bash
  vim ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- If you would like, change the SSH key (by changing the GitHub user name)

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Deploying the malicious pods

- Let's deploy our "exploit"!

.exercise[

- Create the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- Check that the pods are running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- Confirm that the SSH key was added to the node's root account:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Cleaning up

- Before setting up our PodSecurityPolicies, clean up that namespace

.exercise[

- Remove the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete daemonset hacktheplanet
  ```

- Remove the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment web
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies in theory

- To use PSPs, we need to activate their specific *admission controller*

- That admission controller will intercept each pod creation attempt

- It will look at:

  - *who/what* is creating the pod

  - which PodSecurityPolicies they can use

  - which PodSecurityPolicies can be used by the Pod's ServiceAccount

- Then it will compare the Pod with each PodSecurityPolicy one by one

- If a PodSecurityPolicy accepts all the parameters of the Pod, it is created

- Otherwise, the Pod creation is denied and it won't even show up in `kubectl get pods`

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies fine print

- With RBAC, using a PSP corresponds to the verb `use` on the PSP

  (that makes sense, right?)

- If no PSP is defined, no Pod can be created

  (even by cluster admins)

- Pods that are already running are *not* affected

- If we create a Pod directly, it can use a PSP to which *we* have access

- If the Pod is created by e.g. a ReplicaSet or DaemonSet, it's different:

  - the ReplicaSet / DaemonSet controllers don't have access to *our* policies

  - therefore, we need to give access to the PSP to the Pod's ServiceAccount

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Pod Security Policies in practice

- We are going to enable the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller

- At that point, we won't be able to create any more pods (!)

- Then we will create a couple of PodSecurityPolicies

- ...And associated ClusterRoles (giving `use` access to the policies)

- Then we will create RoleBindings to grant these roles to ServiceAccounts

- We will verify that we can't run our "exploit" anymore

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Enabling Pod Security Policies

- To enable Pod Security Policies, we need to enable their *admission plugin*

- This is done by adding a flag to the API server

- On clusters deployed with `kubeadm`, the control plane runs in static pods

- These pods are defined in YAML files located in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`

- Kubelet watches this directory

- Each time a file is added/removed there, kubelet creates/deletes the corresponding pod

- Updating a file causes the pod to be deleted and recreated

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Updating the API server flags

- Let's edit the manifest for the API server pod

.exercise[

- Have a look at the static pods:
  ```bash
  ls -l /etc/kubernetes/manifests
  ```

- Edit the one corresponding to the API server:
  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Adding the PSP admission plugin

- There should already be a line with `--enable-admission-plugins=...`

- Let's add `PodSecurityPolicy` on that line

.exercise[

- Locate the line with `--enable-admission-plugins=`

- Add `PodSecurityPolicy`

  It should read: `--enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy`

- Save, quit

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Waiting for the API server to restart

- The kubelet detects that the file was modified

- It kills the API server pod, and starts a new one

- During that time, the API server is unavailable

.exercise[

- Wait until the API server is available again

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Check that the admission plugin is active

- Normally, we can't create any Pod at this point

.exercise[

- Try to create a Pod directly:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp1 --image=nginx --restart=Never
  ```

- Try to create a Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp2 --image=nginx
  ```

- Look at existing resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

We can get hints at what's happening by looking at the ReplicaSet and Events.

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Introducing our Pod Security Policies

- We will create two policies:

  - privileged (allows everything)

  - restricted (blocks some unsafe mechanisms)

- For each policy, we also need an associated ClusterRole granting *use*

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Creating our Pod Security Policies

- We have a couple of files, each defining a PSP and associated ClusterRole:

  - k8s/psp-privileged.yaml: policy `privileged`, role `psp:privileged`
  - k8s/psp-restricted.yaml: policy `restricted`, role `psp:restricted`

.exercise[

- Create both policies and their associated ClusterRoles:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/psp-restricted.yaml
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/psp-privileged.yaml
  ```
]

- The privileged policy comes from [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#example-policies)

- The restricted policy is inspired by that same documentation page

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Check that we can create Pods again

- We haven't bound the policy to any user yet

- But `cluster-admin` can implicitly `use` all policies

.exercise[

- Check that we can now create a Pod directly:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp3 --image=nginx --restart=Never
  ```

- Create a Deployment as well:
  ```bash
  kubectl run testpsp4 --image=nginx
  ```

- Confirm that the Deployment is *not* creating any Pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- We can create Pods directly (thanks to our root-like permissions)

- The Pods corresponding to a Deployment are created by the ReplicaSet controller

- The ReplicaSet controller does *not* have root-like permissions

- We need to either:

  - grant permissions to the ReplicaSet controller

  *or*

  - grant permissions to our Pods' ServiceAccount

- The first option would allow *anyone* to create pods

- The second option will allow us to scope the permissions better

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Binding the restricted policy

- Let's bind the role `psp:restricted` to ServiceAccount `green:default`

  (aka the default ServiceAccount in the green Namespace)

- This will allow Pod creation in the green Namespace

  (because these Pods will be using that ServiceAccount automatically)

.exercise[

- Create the following RoleBinding:
  ```bash
    kubectl create rolebinding psp:restricted \
            --clusterrole=psp:restricted \
            --serviceaccount=green:default
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Trying it out

- The Deployments that we created earlier will *eventually* recover

  (the ReplicaSet controller will retry to create Pods once in a while)

- If we create a new Deployment now, it should work immediately

.exercise[

- Create a simple Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment testpsp5 --image=nginx
  ```

- Look at the Pods that have been created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## Trying to hack the cluster

- Let's create the same DaemonSet we used earlier

.exercise[

- Create a hostile DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f ~/container.training/k8s/hacktheplanet.yaml
  ```

- Look at the state of the namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

## What's in our restricted policy?

- The restricted PSP is similar to the one provided in the docs, but:

  - it allows containers to run as root

  - it doesn't drop capabilities

- Many containers run as root by default, and would require additional tweaks

- Many containers use e.g. `chown`, which requires a specific capability

  (that's the case for the NGINX official image, for instance)

- We still block: hostPath, privileged containers, and much more!

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The case of static pods

- If we list the pods in the `kube-system` namespace, `kube-apiserver` is missing

- However, the API server is obviously running

  (otherwise, `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system` wouldn't work)

- The API server Pod is created directly by kubelet

  (without going through the PSP admission plugin)

- Then, kubelet creates a "mirror pod" representing that Pod in etcd

- That "mirror pod" creation goes through the PSP admission plugin

- And it gets blocked!

- This can be fixed by binding `psp:privileged` to group `system:nodes`

.debug[[k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/podsecuritypolicy.md)]
---

## .warning[Before moving on...]

- Our cluster is currently broken

  (we can't create pods in namespaces kube-system, default, ...)

- We need to either:

  - disable the PSP admission plugin

  - allow use of PSP to relevant users and groups

- For instance, we could:

  - bind `psp:restricted` to the group `system:authenticated`

  - bind `psp:privileged` to the ServiceAccount `kube-system:default`

# Volumes

- Volumes are special directories that are mounted in containers

- Volumes can have many different purposes:

  - share files and directories between containers running on the same machine

  - share files and directories between containers and their host

  - centralize configuration information in Kubernetes and expose it to containers

  - manage credentials and secrets and expose them securely to containers

  - store persistent data for stateful services

  - access storage systems (like Ceph, EBS, NFS, Portworx, and many others)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Kubernetes volumes vs. Docker volumes

- Kubernetes and Docker volumes are very similar

  (the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) says otherwise ...
  <br/>
  but it refers to Docker 1.7, which was released in 2015!)

- Docker volumes allow us to share data between containers running on the same host

- Kubernetes volumes allow us to share data between containers in the same pod

- Both Docker and Kubernetes volumes enable access to storage systems

- Kubernetes volumes are also used to expose configuration and secrets

- Docker has specific concepts for configuration and secrets
  <br/>
  (but under the hood, the technical implementation is similar)

- If you're not familiar with Docker volumes, you can safely ignore this slide!

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes ≠ Persistent Volumes

- Volumes and Persistent Volumes are related, but very different!

- *Volumes*:

  - appear in Pod specifications (see next slide)

  - do not exist as API resources (**cannot** do `kubectl get volumes`)

- *Persistent Volumes*:

  - are API resources (**can** do `kubectl get persistentvolumes`)

  - correspond to concrete volumes (e.g. on a SAN, EBS, etc.)

  - cannot be associated with a Pod directly; but through a Persistent Volume Claim

  - won't be discussed further in this section

---

## A simple volume example, explained

- We define a standalone `Pod` named `nginx-with-volume`

- In that pod, there is a volume named `www`

- No type is specified, so it will default to `emptyDir`

  (as the name implies, it will be initialized as an empty directory at pod creation)

- In that pod, there is also a container named `nginx`

- That container mounts the volume `www` to path `/usr/share/nginx/html/`

## Sharing a volume, explained

- We added another container to the pod

- That container mounts the `www` volume on a different path (`/www`)

- It uses the `alpine` image

- When started, it installs `git` and clones the `octocat/Spoon-Knife` repository

  (that repository contains a tiny HTML website)

- As a result, NGINX now serves this website

## Sharing a volume, in action

- Let's try it!

.exercise[

- Create the pod by applying the YAML file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/nginx-with-volume.yaml
  ```

- Check the IP address that was allocated to our pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

- Access the web server:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## The devil is in the details

- The default `restartPolicy` is `Always`

- This would cause our `git` container to run again ... and again ... and again

  (with an exponential back-off delay, as explained [in the documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy))

- That's why we specified `restartPolicy: OnFailure`

- There is a short period of time during which the website is not available

  (because the `git` container hasn't done its job yet)

- This could be avoided by using [Init Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)

  (we will see a live example in a few sections)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volume lifecycle

- The lifecycle of a volume is linked to the pod's lifecycle

- This means that a volume is created when the pod is created

- This is mostly relevant for `emptyDir` volumes

  (other volumes, like remote storage, are not "created" but rather "attached" )

- A volume survives across container restarts

- A volume is destroyed (or, for remote storage, detached) when the pod is destroyed

# Managing configuration

- Some applications need to be configured (obviously!)

- There are many ways for our code to pick up configuration:

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - configuration files

  - configuration servers (getting configuration from a database, an API...)

  - ... and more (because programmers can be very creative!)

- How can we do these things with containers and Kubernetes?

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing configuration to containers

- There are many ways to pass configuration to code running in a container:

  - baking it into a custom image

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - injecting configuration files

  - exposing it over the Kubernetes API

  - configuration servers

- Let's review these different strategies!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Baking custom images

- Put the configuration in the image

  (it can be in a configuration file, but also `ENV` or `CMD` actions)

- It's easy! It's simple!

- Unfortunately, it also has downsides:

  - multiplication of images

  - different images for dev, staging, prod ...

  - minor reconfigurations require a whole build/push/pull cycle

- Avoid doing it unless you don't have the time to figure out other options

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments

- Pass options to `args` array in the container specification

- Example ([source](https://github.com/coreos/pods/blob/master/kubernetes.yaml#L29)): 
  ```yaml
      args: 
        - "--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd"
        - "--advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-peer-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2380"
        - "--name=etcd"
  ```

- The options can be passed directly to the program that we run ...

  ... or to a wrapper script that will use them to e.g. generate a config file

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments, pros & cons

- Works great when options are passed directly to the running program

  (otherwise, a wrapper script can work around the issue)

- Works great when there aren't too many parameters

  (to avoid a 20-lines `args` array)

- Requires documentation and/or understanding of the underlying program

  ("which parameters and flags do I need, again?")

- Well-suited for mandatory parameters (without default values)

- Not ideal when we need to pass a real configuration file anyway

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables

- Pass options through the `env` map in the container specification

- Example:
  ```yaml
      env:
      - name: ADMIN_PORT
        value: "8080"
      - name: ADMIN_AUTH
        value: Basic
      - name: ADMIN_CRED
        value: "admin:0pensesame!"
  ```

.warning[`value` must be a string! Make sure that numbers and fancy strings are quoted.]

🤔 Why this weird `{name: xxx, value: yyy}` scheme? It will be revealed soon!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## The downward API

- In the previous example, environment variables have fixed values

- We can also use a mechanism called the *downward API*

- The downward API allows exposing pod or container information

  - either through special files (we won't show that for now)

  - or through environment variables

- The value of these environment variables is computed when the container is started

- Remember: environment variables won't (can't) change after container start

- Let's see a few concrete examples!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's namespace

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

- Useful to generate FQDN of services

  (in some contexts, a short name is not enough)

- For instance, the two commands should be equivalent:
  ```
  curl api-backend
  curl api-backend.$MY_POD_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's IP address

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- Useful if we need to know our IP address

  (we could also read it from `eth0`, but this is more solid)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the container's resource limits

```yaml
    - name: MY_MEM_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test-container
          resource: limits.memory
```

- Useful for runtimes where memory is garbage collected

- Example: the JVM

  (the memory available to the JVM should be set with the `-Xmx ` flag)

- Best practice: set a memory limit, and pass it to the runtime

  (see [this blog post](https://very-serio.us/2017/12/05/running-jvms-in-kubernetes/) for a detailed example)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## More about the downward API

- [This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/) tells more about these environment variables

- And [this one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) explains the other way to use the downward API

  (through files that get created in the container filesystem)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables, pros and cons

- Works great when the running program expects these variables

- Works great for optional parameters with reasonable defaults

  (since the container image can provide these defaults)

- Sort of auto-documented

  (we can see which environment variables are defined in the image, and their values)

- Can be (ab)used with longer values ...

- ... You *can* put an entire Tomcat configuration file in an environment ...

- ... But *should* you?

(Do it if you really need to, we're not judging! But we'll see better ways.)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Injecting configuration files

- Sometimes, there is no way around it: we need to inject a full config file

- Kubernetes provides a mechanism for that purpose: `configmaps`

- A configmap is a Kubernetes resource that exists in a namespace

- Conceptually, it's a key/value map

  (values are arbitrary strings)

- We can think about them in (at least) two different ways:

  - as holding entire configuration file(s)

  - as holding individual configuration parameters

*Note: to hold sensitive information, we can use "Secrets", which
are another type of resource behaving very much like configmaps.
We'll cover them just after!*

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing entire files

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a configuration file

- Key = name of the file

- Value = content of the file

- There can be one key/value pair, or as many as necessary

  (for complex apps with multiple configuration files)

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf"
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf" but another file
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf=app-prod.conf
  # Create a configmap with multiple keys (one per file in the config.d directory)
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=config.d/
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing individual parameters

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a parameter

- Key = name of the parameter

- Value = value of the parameter

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with two keys
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-literal=foreground=red \
      --from-literal=background=blue
  
  # Create a configmap from a file containing key=val pairs
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-env-file=app.conf
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing configmaps to containers

- Configmaps can be exposed as plain files in the filesystem of a container

  - this is achieved by declaring a volume and mounting it in the container

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing whole files

- Configmaps can be exposed as environment variables in the container

  - this is achieved with the downward API

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing individual parameters

- Let's see how to do both!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing a configuration file with a configmap

- We will start a load balancer powered by HAProxy

- We will use the [official `haproxy` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy/)

- It expects to find its configuration in `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

- We will provide a simple HAproxy configuration, `k8s/haproxy.cfg`

- It listens on port 80, and load balances connections between IBM and Google

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.exercise[

- Go to the `k8s` directory in the repository:
  ```bash
  cd ~/container.training/k8s
  ```

- Create a configmap named `haproxy` and holding the configuration file:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap haproxy --from-file=haproxy.cfg
  ```

- Check what our configmap looks like:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap haproxy -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

We are going to use the following pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: haproxy
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: haproxy
  containers:
  - name: haproxy

## Using the configmap

- The resource definition from the previous slide is in `k8s/haproxy.yaml`

.exercise[

- Create the HAProxy pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/haproxy.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod haproxy --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod haproxy -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod haproxy -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Testing our load balancer

- The load balancer will send:

  - half of the connections to Google

  - the other half to IBM

.exercise[

- Access the load balancer a few times:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  ```

]

We should see connections served by Google, and others served by IBM.

## Exposing configmaps with the downward API

- We are going to run a Docker registry on a custom port

- By default, the registry listens on port 5000

- This can be changed by setting environment variable `REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR`

- We are going to store the port number in a configmap

- Then we will expose that configmap as a container environment variable

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.exercise[

- Our configmap will have a single key, `http.addr`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap registry --from-literal=http.addr=0.0.0.0:80
  ```

- Check our configmap:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap registry -o yaml
  ```

  - name: registry
    image: registry
    env:

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod registry --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod registry -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod registry -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

## Passwords, tokens, sensitive information

- For sensitive information, there is another special resource: *Secrets*

- Secrets and Configmaps work almost the same way

  (we'll expose the differences on the next slide)

- The *intent* is different, though:

  *"You should use secrets for things which are actually secret like API keys, 
  credentials, etc., and use config map for not-secret configuration data."*

  *"In the future there will likely be some differentiators for secrets like rotation or support for backing the secret API w/ HSMs, etc."*

  (Source: [the author of both features](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36925553/580281

---

## Differences between configmaps and secrets
 
- Secrets are base64-encoded when shown with `kubectl get secrets -o yaml`

  - keep in mind that this is just *encoding*, not *encryption*

  - it is very easy to [automatically extract and decode secrets](https://medium.com/@mveritym/decoding-kubernetes-secrets-60deed7a96a3)

- [Secrets can be encrypted at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

- With RBAC, we can authorize a user to access configmaps, but not secrets

  (since they are two different kinds of resources)

# Stateful sets

- Stateful sets are a type of resource in the Kubernetes API

  (like pods, deployments, services...)

- They offer mechanisms to deploy scaled stateful applications

- At a first glance, they look like *deployments*:

  - a stateful set defines a pod spec and a number of replicas *R*

  - it will make sure that *R* copies of the pod are running

  - that number can be changed while the stateful set is running

  - updating the pod spec will cause a rolling update to happen

- But they also have some significant differences

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful sets unique features

- Pods in a stateful set are numbered (from 0 to *R-1*) and ordered

- They are started and updated in order (from 0 to *R-1*)

- A pod is started (or updated) only when the previous one is ready

- They are stopped in reverse order (from *R-1* to 0)

- Each pod know its identity (i.e. which number it is in the set)

- Each pod can discover the IP address of the others easily

- The pods can persist data on attached volumes

🤔 Wait a minute ... Can't we already attach volumes to pods and deployments?

## Revisiting volumes

- [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) are used for many purposes:

  - sharing data between containers in a pod

  - exposing configuration information and secrets to containers

  - accessing storage systems

- Let's see examples of the latter usage

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Volumes types

- There are many [types of volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes) available:

  - public cloud storage (GCEPersistentDisk, AWSElasticBlockStore, AzureDisk...)

  - private cloud storage (Cinder, VsphereVolume...)

  - traditional storage systems (NFS, iSCSI, FC...)

  - distributed storage (Ceph, Glusterfs, Portworx...)

- Using a persistent volume requires:

  - creating the volume out-of-band (outside of the Kubernetes API)

  - referencing the volume in the pod description, with all its parameters

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using a cloud volume

Here is a pod definition using an AWS EBS volume (that has to be created first):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-ebs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-ebs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-ebs
      name: my-ebs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-ebs-volume
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: vol-049df61146c4d7901
      fsType: ext4
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using an NFS volume

Here is another example using a volume on an NFS server:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-my-nfs-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-my-nfs-volume
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-nfs
      name: my-nfs-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-nfs-volume
      nfs:
        server: 192.168.0.55
        path: "/exports/assets"
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Shortcomings of volumes

- Their lifecycle (creation, deletion...) is managed outside of the Kubernetes API

  (we can't just use `kubectl apply/create/delete/...` to manage them)

- If a Deployment uses a volume, all replicas end up using the same volume

- That volume must then support concurrent access

  - some volumes do (e.g. NFS servers support multiple read/write access)

  - some volumes support concurrent reads

  - some volumes support concurrent access for colocated pods

- What we really need is a way for each replica to have its own volume

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims

- To abstract the different types of storage, a pod can use a special volume type

- This type is a *Persistent Volume Claim*

- A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a resource type

  (visible with `kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims` or `kubectl get pvc`)

- A PVC is not a volume; it is a *request for a volume*

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims in practice

- Using a Persistent Volume Claim is a two-step process:

  - creating the claim

  - using the claim in a pod (as if it were any other kind of volume)

- A PVC starts by being Unbound (without an associated volume)

- Once it is associated with a Persistent Volume, it becomes Bound

- A Pod referring an unbound PVC will not start

  (but as soon as the PVC is bound, the Pod can start)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Binding PV and PVC

- A Kubernetes controller continuously watches PV and PVC objects

- When it notices an unbound PVC, it tries to find a satisfactory PV

  ("satisfactory" in terms of size and other characteristics; see next slide)

- If no PV fits the PVC, a PV can be created dynamically

  (this requires to configure a *dynamic provisioner*, more on that later)

- Otherwise, the PVC remains unbound indefinitely

  (until we manually create a PV or setup dynamic provisioning)

## What's in a Persistent Volume Claim?

- At the very least, the claim should indicate:

  - the size of the volume (e.g. "5 GiB")

  - the access mode (e.g. "read-write by a single pod")

- Optionally, it can also specify a Storage Class

- The Storage Class indicates:

  - which storage system to use (e.g. Portworx, EBS...)

  - extra parameters for that storage system

    e.g.: "replicate the data 3 times, and use SSD media"

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## What's a Storage Class?

- A Storage Class is yet another Kubernetes API resource

  (visible with e.g. `kubectl get storageclass` or `kubectl get sc`)

- It indicates which *provisioner* to use

  (which controller will create the actual volume)

- And arbitrary parameters for that provisioner

  (replication levels, type of disk ... anything relevant!)

- Storage Classes are required if we want to use [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)

  (but we can also create volumes manually, and ignore Storage Classes)

## Defining a Persistent Volume Claim

Here is a minimal PVC:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: my-claim
spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Using a Persistent Volume Claim

Here is a Pod definition like the ones shown earlier, but using a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-a-claim
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-a-claim
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-vol
      name: my-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-claim
```

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Persistent Volume Claims and Stateful sets

- The pods in a stateful set can define a `volumeClaimTemplate`

- A `volumeClaimTemplate` will dynamically create one Persistent Volume Claim per pod

- Each pod will therefore have its own volume

- These volumes are numbered (like the pods)

- When updating the stateful set (e.g. image upgrade), each pod keeps its volume

- When pods get rescheduled (e.g. node failure), they keep their volume

  (this requires a storage system that is not node-local)

- These volumes are not automatically deleted

  (when the stateful set is scaled down or deleted)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Stateful set recap

- A Stateful sets manages a number of identical pods

  (like a Deployment)

- These pods are numbered, and started/upgraded/stopped in a specific order

- These pods are aware of their number

  (e.g., #0 can decide to be the primary, and #1 can be secondary)

- These pods can find the IP addresses of the other pods in the set

  (through a *headless service*)

- These pods can each have their own persistent storage

  (Deployments cannot do that)

# Running a Consul cluster

- Here is a good use-case for Stateful sets!

- We are going to deploy a Consul cluster with 3 nodes

- Consul is a highly-available key/value store

  (like etcd or Zookeeper)

- One easy way to bootstrap a cluster is to tell each node:

  - the addresses of other nodes

  - how many nodes are expected (to know when quorum is reached)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Bootstrapping a Consul cluster

*After reading the Consul documentation carefully (and/or asking around),
we figure out the minimal command-line to run our Consul cluster.*

```
consul agent -data=dir=/consul/data -client=0.0.0.0 -server -ui \
       -bootstrap-expect=3 \
       -retry-join=`X.X.X.X` \
       -retry-join=`Y.Y.Y.Y`
```

- Replace X.X.X.X and Y.Y.Y.Y with the addresses of other nodes

- The same command-line can be used on all nodes (convenient!)

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Cloud Auto-join

- Since version 1.4.0, Consul can use the Kubernetes API to find its peers

- This is called [Cloud Auto-join]

- Instead of passing an IP address, we need to pass a parameter like this:

  ```
  consul agent -retry-join "provider=k8s label_selector=\"app=consul\""
  ```

- Consul needs to be able to talk to the Kubernetes API

- We can provide a `kubeconfig` file

- If Consul runs in a pod, it will use the *service account* of the pod

[Cloud Auto-join]: https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/cloud-auto-join.html#kubernetes-k8s-

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Setting up Cloud auto-join

- We need to create a service account for Consul

- We need to create a role that can `list` and `get` pods

- We need to bind that role to the service account

- And of course, we need to make sure that Consul pods use that service account

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Putting it all together

- The file `k8s/consul.yaml` defines the required resources

  (service account, cluster role, cluster role binding, service, stateful set)

- It has a few extra touches:

  - a `podAntiAffinity` prevents two pods from running on the same node

  - a `preStop` hook makes the pod leave the cluster when shutdown gracefully

This was inspired by this [excellent tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/consul-on-kubernetes) by Kelsey Hightower.
Some features from the original tutorial (TLS authentication between
nodes and encryption of gossip traffic) were removed for simplicity.

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Running our Consul cluster

- We'll use the provided YAML file

.exercise[

- Create the stateful set and associated service:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/consul.yaml
  ```

- Check the logs as the pods come up one after another:
  ```bash
  stern consul
  ```

<!--
```wait Synced node info```
```keys ^C```
-->

- Check the health of the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Caveats

- We haven't used a `volumeClaimTemplate` here

- That's because we don't have a storage provider yet

  (except if you're running this on your own and your cluster has one)

- What happens if we lose a pod?

  - a new pod gets rescheduled (with an empty state)

  - the new pod tries to connect to the two others

  - it will be accepted (after 1-2 minutes of instability)

  - and it will retrieve the data from the other pods

.debug[[k8s/statefulsets.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/statefulsets.md)]
---

## Failure modes

- What happens if we lose two pods?

  - manual repair will be required

  - we will need to instruct the remaining one to act solo

  - then rejoin new pods

- What happens if we lose three pods? (aka all of them)

  - we lose all the data (ouch)

- If we run Consul without persistent storage, backups are a good idea!

# Local Persistent Volumes

- We want to run that Consul cluster *and* actually persist data

- But we don't have a distributed storage system

- We are going to use local volumes instead

  (similar conceptually to `hostPath` volumes)

- We can use local volumes without installing extra plugins

- However, they are tied to a node

- If that node goes down, the volume becomes unavailable

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## With or without dynamic provisioning

- We will deploy a Consul cluster *with* persistence

- That cluster's StatefulSet will create PVCs

- These PVCs will remain unbound¹, until we will create local volumes manually

  (we will basically do the job of the dynamic provisioner)

- Then, we will see how to automate that with a dynamic provisioner

.footnote[¹Unbound = without an associated Persistent Volume.]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## If we have a dynamic provisioner ...

- The labs in this section assume that we *do not* have a dynamic provisioner

- If we do have one, we need to disable it

.exercise[

- Check if we have a dynamic provisioner:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclass
  ```

- If the output contains a line with `(default)`, run this command:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate sc storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class- --all
  ```

- Check again that it is no longer marked as `(default)`

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Work in a separate namespace

- To avoid conflicts with existing resources, let's create and use a new namespace

.exercise[

- Create a new namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace orange
  ```

- Switch to that namespace:
  ```bash
  kns orange
  ```

]

.warning[Make sure to call that namespace `orange`: it is hardcoded in the YAML files.]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Deploying Consul

- We will use a slightly different YAML file

- The only differences between that file and the previous one are:

  - `volumeClaimTemplate` defined in the Stateful Set spec

  - the corresponding `volumeMounts` in the Pod spec

  - the namespace `orange` used for discovery of Pods

.exercise[

- Apply the persistent Consul YAML file:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/persistent-consul.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Observing the situation

- Let's look at Persistent Volume Claims and Pods

.exercise[

- Check that we now have an unbound Persistent Volume Claim:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pvc
  ```

- We don't have any Persistent Volume:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pv
  ```

- The Pod `consul-0` is not scheduled yet:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

*Hint: leave these commands running with `-w` in different windows.*

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Explanations

- In a Stateful Set, the Pods are started one by one

- `consul-1` won't be created until `consul-0` is running

- `consul-0` has a dependency on an unbound Persistent Volume Claim

- The scheduler won't schedule the Pod until the PVC is bound

  (because the PVC might be bound to a volume that is only available on a subset of nodes; for instance EBS are tied to an availability zone)

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Creating Persistent Volumes

- Let's create 3 local directories (`/mnt/consul`) on node2, node3, node4

- Then create 3 Persistent Volumes corresponding to these directories

.exercise[

- Create the local directories:
  ```bash
    for NODE in node2 node3 node4; do
      ssh $NODE sudo mkdir -p /mnt/consul
    done
  ```

- Create the PV objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/volumes-for-consul.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Check our Consul cluster

- The PVs that we created will be automatically matched with the PVCs

- Once a PVC is bound, its pod can start normally

- Once the pod `consul-0` has started, `consul-1` can be created, etc.

- Eventually, our Consul cluster is up, and backend by "persistent" volumes

.exercise[

- Check that our Consul clusters has 3 members indeed:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec consul-0 consul members
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (1/2)

- The size of the Persistent Volumes is bogus

  (it is used when matching PVs and PVCs together, but there is no actual quota or limit)

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Devil is in the details (2/2)

- This specific example worked because we had exactly 1 free PV per node:

  - if we had created multiple PVs per node ...

  - we could have ended with two PVCs bound to PVs on the same node ...

  - which would have required two pods to be on the same node ...

  - which is forbidden by the anti-affinity constraints in the StatefulSet

- To avoid that, we need to associated the PVs with a Storage Class that has:
  ```yaml
  volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
  ```
  (this means that a PVC will be bound to a PV only after being used by a Pod)

- See [this blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/) for more details

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Bulk provisioning

- It's not practical to manually create directories and PVs for each app

- We *could* pre-provision a number of PVs across our fleet

- We could even automate that with a Daemon Set:

  - creating a number of directories on each node

  - creating the corresponding PV objects

- We also need to recycle volumes

- ... This can quickly get out of hand

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Dynamic provisioning

- We could also write our own provisioner, which would:

  - watch the PVCs across all namespaces

  - when a PVC is created, create a corresponding PV on a node

- Or we could use one of the dynamic provisioners for local persistent volumes

  (for instance the [Rancher local path provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner))

.debug[[k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/local-persistent-volumes.md)]
---

## Strategies for local persistent volumes

- Remember, when a node goes down, the volumes on that node become unavailable

- High availability will require another layer of replication

  (like what we've just seen with Consul; or primary/secondary; etc)

- Pre-provisioning PVs makes sense for machines with local storage

  (e.g. cloud instance storage; or storage directly attached to a physical machine)

- Dynamic provisioning makes sense for large number of applications

  (when we can't or won't dedicate a whole disk to a volume)

- It's possible to mix both (using distinct Storage Classes)

# Highly available Persistent Volumes

- How can we achieve true durability?

- How can we store data that would survive the loss of a node?

--

- We need to use Persistent Volumes backed by highly available storage systems

- There are many ways to achieve that:

  - leveraging our cloud's storage APIs

  - using NAS/SAN systems or file servers

  - distributed storage systems

--

- We are going to see one distributed storage system in action

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Our test scenario

- We will set up a distributed storage system on our cluster

- We will use it to deploy a SQL database (PostgreSQL)

- We will insert some test data in the database

- We will disrupt the node running the database

- We will see how it recovers

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Portworx

- Portworx is a *commercial* persistent storage solution for containers

- It works with Kubernetes, but also Mesos, Swarm ...

- It provides [hyper-converged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure) storage

  (=storage is provided by regular compute nodes)

- We're going to use it here because it can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster

  (it doesn't require any particular infrastructure)

- We don't endorse or support Portworx in any particular way

  (but we appreciate that it's super easy to install!)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## A useful reminder

- We're installing Portworx because we need a storage system

- If you are using AKS, EKS, GKE ... you already have a storage system

  (but you might want another one, e.g. to leverage local storage)

- If you have setup Kubernetes yourself, there are other solutions available too

  - on premises, you can use a good old SAN/NAS

  - on a private cloud like OpenStack, you can use e.g. Cinder

  - everywhere, you can use other systems, e.g. Gluster, StorageOS

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Portworx requirements

- Kubernetes cluster ✔️

- Optional key/value store (etcd or Consul) ❌

- At least one available block device ❌

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## The key-value store

- In the current version of Portworx (1.4) it is recommended to use etcd or Consul

- But Portworx also has beta support for an embedded key/value store

- For simplicity, we are going to use the latter option

  (but if we have deployed Consul or etcd, we can use that, too)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## One available block device

- Block device = disk or partition on a disk

- We can see block devices with `lsblk`

  (or `cat /proc/partitions` if we're old school like that!)

- If we don't have a spare disk or partition, we can use a *loop device*

- A loop device is a block device actually backed by a file

- These are frequently used to mount ISO (CD/DVD) images or VM disk images

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Setting up a loop device

- We are going to create a 10 GB (empty) file on each node

- Then make a loop device from it, to be used by Portworx

.exercise[

- Create a 10 GB file on each node:
  ```bash
  for N in $(seq 1 4); do ssh node$N sudo truncate --size 10G /portworx.blk; done
  ```
  (If SSH asks to confirm host keys, enter `yes` each time.)

- Associate the file to a loop device on each node:
  ```bash
  for N in $(seq 1 4); do ssh node$N sudo losetup /dev/loop4 /portworx.blk; done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Installing Portworx

- To install Portworx, we need to go to https://install.portworx.com/

- This website will ask us a bunch of questions about our cluster

- Then, it will generate a YAML file that we should apply to our cluster

--

- Or, we can just apply that YAML file directly (it's in `k8s/portworx.yaml`)

.exercise[

- Install Portworx:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/portworx.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Generating a custom YAML file

If you want to generate a YAML file tailored to your own needs, the easiest
way is to use https://install.portworx.com/.

FYI, this is how we obtained the YAML file used earlier:
```bash
KBVER=$(kubectl version -o json | jq -r .serverVersion.gitVersion)
BLKDEV=/dev/loop4
curl https://install.portworx.com/1.4/?kbver=$KBVER&b=true&s=$BLKDEV&c=px-workshop&stork=true&lh=true
```
If you want to use an external key/value store, add one of the following:
```
&k=etcd://`XXX`:2379
&k=consul://`XXX`:8500
```
... where `XXX` is the name or address of your etcd or Consul server.

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Waiting for Portworx to be ready

- The installation process will take a few minutes

.exercise[

- Check out the logs:
  ```bash
  stern -n kube-system portworx
  ```

- Wait until it gets quiet

  (you should see `portworx service is healthy`, too)

<!--
```longwait PX node status reports portworx service is healthy```
```keys ^C```
-->

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes

- We are going to run PostgreSQL in a Stateful set

- The Stateful set will specify a `volumeClaimTemplate`

- That `volumeClaimTemplate` will create Persistent Volume Claims

- Kubernetes' [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) will satisfy these Persistent Volume Claims

  (by creating Persistent Volumes and binding them to the claims)

- The Persistent Volumes are then available for the PostgreSQL pods

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Storage Classes

- It's possible that multiple storage systems are available

- Or, that a storage system offers multiple tiers of storage

  (SSD vs. magnetic; mirrored or not; etc.)

- We need to tell Kubernetes *which* system and tier to use

- This is achieved by creating a Storage Class

- A `volumeClaimTemplate` can indicate which Storage Class to use

- It is also possible to mark a Storage Class as "default"

  (it will be used if a `volumeClaimTemplate` doesn't specify one)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Our default Storage Class

This is our Storage Class (in `k8s/storage-class.yaml`):

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:

## Creating our Storage Class

- Let's apply that YAML file!

.exercise[

- Create the Storage Class:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/storage-class.yaml
  ```

- Check that it is now available:
  ```bash
  kubectl get sc
  ```

]

It should show as `portworx-replicated (default)`.

## Our Postgres Stateful set

- The next slide shows `k8s/postgres.yaml`

- It defines a Stateful set

- With a `volumeClaimTemplate` requesting a 1 GB volume

- That volume will be mounted to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`

- There is another little detail: we enable the `stork` scheduler

- The `stork` scheduler is optional (it's specific to Portworx)

- It helps the Kubernetes scheduler to colocate the pod with its volume

  (see [this blog post](https://portworx.com/stork-storage-orchestration-kubernetes/) for more details about that)

## Creating the Stateful set

- Before applying the YAML, watch what's going on with `kubectl get events -w`

.exercise[

- Apply that YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/postgres.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod postgres-0 --for condition=ready``` -->

## Testing our PostgreSQL pod

- We will use `kubectl exec` to get a shell in the pod

- Good to know: we need to use the `postgres` user in the pod

.exercise[

- Get a shell in the pod, as the `postgres` user:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 su postgres
  ```

<!--
autopilot prompt detection expects $ or # at the beginning of the line.
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Check that default databases have been created correctly:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

]

(This should show us 3 lines: postgres, template0, and template1.)

## Inserting data in PostgreSQL

- We will create a database and populate it with `pgbench`

.exercise[

- Create a database named `demo`:
  ```bash
  createdb demo
  ```

- Populate it with `pgbench`:
  ```bash
  pgbench -i -s 10 demo
  ```

]

- The `-i` flag means "create tables"

- The `-s 10` flag means "create 10 x 100,000 rows"

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Checking how much data we have now

- The `pgbench` tool inserts rows in table `pgbench_accounts`

.exercise[

- Check that the `demo` base exists:
  ```bash
  psql -l
  ```

- Check how many rows we have in `pgbench_accounts`:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_accounts"
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

(We should see a count of 1,000,000 rows.)

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Find out which node is hosting the database

- We can find that information with `kubectl get pods -o wide`

.exercise[

- Check the node running the database:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

]

We are going to disrupt that node.

--

By "disrupt" we mean: "disconnect it from the network".

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Disconnect the node

- We will use `iptables` to block all traffic exiting the node

  (except SSH traffic, so we can repair the node later if needed)

.exercise[

- SSH to the node to disrupt:
  ```bash
  ssh `nodeX`
  ```

- Allow SSH traffic leaving the node, but block all other traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -j ACCEPT
  sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -j DROP
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Check that the node is disconnected

.exercise[

- Check that the node can't communicate with other nodes:
  ```
  ping node1
  ```

- Logout to go back on `node1`

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

- Watch the events unfolding with `kubectl get events -w` and `kubectl get pods -w`

]

- It will take some time for Kubernetes to mark the node as unhealthy

- Then it will attempt to reschedule the pod to another node

- In about a minute, our pod should be up and running again

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Check that our data is still available

- We are going to reconnect to the (new) pod and check

.exercise[

- Get a shell on the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -ti postgres-0 su postgres
  ```

<!--
```wait postgres@postgres```
```keys PS1="\u@\h:\w\n\$ "```
```keys ^J```
-->

- Check the number of rows in the `pgbench_accounts` table:
  ```bash
  psql demo -c "select count(*) from pgbench_accounts"
  ```

<!-- ```keys ^D``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Double-check that the pod has really moved

- Just to make sure the system is not bluffing!

.exercise[

- Look at which node the pod is now running on
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod postgres-0 -o wide
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/portworx.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/portworx.md)]
---

## Re-enable the node

- Let's fix the node that we disconnected from the network

.exercise[

- SSH to the node:
  ```bash
  ssh `nodeX`
  ```

- Remove the iptables rule blocking traffic:
  ```bash
  sudo iptables -D OUTPUT 2
  ```

## A few words about this PostgreSQL setup

- In a real deployment, you would want to set a password

- This can be done by creating a `secret`:
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic postgres \
          --from-literal=password=$(base64 /dev/urandom | head -c16)
  ```

- And then passing that secret to the container:
  ```yaml
  env:
  - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: postgres
        key: password
  ```

## Troubleshooting Portworx

- If we need to see what's going on with Portworx:
  ```
  PXPOD=$(kubectl -n kube-system get pod -l name=portworx -o json | 
  	      jq -r .items[0].metadata.name)
  kubectl -n kube-system exec $PXPOD -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
  ```

- We can also connect to Lighthouse (a web UI)

  - check the port with `kubectl -n kube-system get svc px-lighthouse`

  - connect to that port

  - the default login/password is `admin/Password1`

  - then specify `portworx-service` as the endpoint

## Removing Portworx

- Portworx provides a storage driver

- It needs to place itself "above" the Kubelet

  (it installs itself straight on the nodes)

- To remove it, we need to do more than just deleting its Kubernetes resources

- It is done by applying a special label:
  ```
  kubectl label nodes --all px/enabled=remove --overwrite
  ```

- Then removing a bunch of local files:
  ```
  sudo chattr -i /etc/pwx/.private.json
  sudo rm -rf /etc/pwx /opt/pwx
  ```

  (on each node where Portworx was running)

---

class: extra-details

## Dynamic provisioning without a provider

- What if we want to use Stateful sets without a storage provider?

- We will have to create volumes manually

  (by creating Persistent Volume objects)

- These volumes will be automatically bound with matching Persistent Volume Claims

- We can use local volumes (essentially bind mounts of host directories)

- Of course, these volumes won't be available in case of node failure

- Check [this blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/13/local-persistent-volumes-beta/) for more information and gotchas

## Acknowledgements

The Portworx installation tutorial, and the PostgreSQL example,
were inspired by [Portworx examples on Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/), in particular:

- [installing Portworx on Kubernetes](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/deploy-px-k8s)

  (with adapatations to use a loop device and an embedded key/value store)

- [persistent volumes on Kubernetes using Portworx](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/px-k8s-vol-basic)

  (with adapatations to specify a default Storage Class)

- [HA PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with Portworx](https://www.katacoda.com/portworx/scenarios/px-k8s-postgres-all-in-one)

  (with adaptations to use a Stateful Set and simplify PostgreSQL's setup)

# Kubernetes architecture

We can arbitrarily split Kubernetes in two parts:

- the *nodes*, a set of machines that run our containerized workloads;

- the *control plane*, a set of processes implementing the Kubernetes APIs.

Kubernetes also relies on underlying infrastructure:

- servers, network connectivity (obviously!),

- optional components like storage systems, load balancers ...

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Control plane location

The control plane can run:

- in containers, on the same nodes that run other application workloads

  (example: Minikube; 1 node runs everything)

- on a dedicated node

  (example: a cluster installed with kubeadm)

- on a dedicated set of nodes

  (example: Kubernetes The Hard Way; kops)

- outside of the cluster

  (example: most managed clusters like AKS, EKS, GKE)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What runs on a node

- Our containerized workloads

- A container engine like Docker, CRI-O, containerd...

  (in theory, the choice doesn't matter, as the engine is abstracted by Kubernetes)

- kubelet: an agent connecting the node to the cluster

  (it connects to the API server, registers the node, receives instructions)

- kube-proxy: a component used for internal cluster communication

  (note that this is *not* an overlay network or a CNI plugin!)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What's in the control plane

- Everything is stored in etcd

  (it's the only stateful component)

- Everyone communicates exclusively through the API server:

  - we (users) interact with the cluster through the API server

  - the nodes register and get their instructions through the API server

  - the other control plane components also register with the API server

- API server is the only component that reads/writes from/to etcd

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Communication protocols: API server

- The API server exposes a REST API

  (except for some calls, e.g. to attach interactively to a container)

- Almost all requests and responses are JSON following a strict format

- For performance, the requests and responses can also be done over protobuf

  (see this [design proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/api-machinery/protobuf.md) for details)

- In practice, protobuf is used for all internal communication

  (between control plane components, and with kubelet)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Communication protocols: on the nodes

The kubelet agent uses a number of special-purpose protocols and interfaces, including:

- CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

  - used for communication with the container engine
  - abstracts the differences between container engines
  - based on gRPC+protobuf

- [CNI (Container Network Interface)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md)

  - used for communication with network plugins
  - network plugins are implemented as executable programs invoked by kubelet
  - network plugins provide IPAM
  - network plugins set up network interfaces in pods

# The Kubernetes API

[
*The Kubernetes API server is a "dumb server" which offers storage, versioning, validation, update, and watch semantics on API resources.*
](
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/api-machinery/protobuf.md#proposal-and-motivation
)

([Clayton Coleman](https://twitter.com/smarterclayton), Kubernetes Architect and Maintainer)

What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## The Kubernetes API is declarative

- We cannot tell the API, "run a pod"

- We can tell the API, "here is the definition for pod X"

- The API server will store that definition (in etcd)

- *Controllers* will then wake up and create a pod matching the definition

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## The core features of the Kubernetes API

- We can create, read, update, and delete objects

- We can also *watch* objects

  (be notified when an object changes, or when an object of a given type is created)

- Objects are strongly typed

- Types are *validated* and *versioned*

- Storage and watch operations are provided by etcd

  (note: the [k3s](https://k3s.io/) project allows us to use sqlite instead of etcd)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Let's experiment a bit!

- For the exercises in this section, connect to the first node of the `test` cluster

.exercise[

- SSH to the first node of the test cluster

- Check that the cluster is operational:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- All nodes should be `Ready`

]

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Create

- Let's create a simple object

.exercise[

- Create a namespace with the following command:
  ```bash
    kubectl create -f- <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: hello
    EOF
  ```

]

This is equivalent to `kubectl create namespace hello`.

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Read

- Let's retrieve the object we just created

.exercise[

- Read back our object:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace hello -o yaml
  ```

]

We see a lot of data that wasn't here when we created the object.

Some data was automatically added to the object (like `spec.finalizers`).

Some data is dynamic (typically, the content of `status`.)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## API requests and responses

- Almost every Kubernetes API payload (requests and responses) has the same format:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: xxx
    kind: yyy
    metadata:
      name: zzz
      (more metadata fields here)
    (more fields here)
  ```

- The fields shown above are mandatory, except for some special cases

  (e.g.: in lists of resources, the list itself doesn't have a `metadata.name`)

- We show YAML for convenience, but the API uses JSON

  (with optional protobuf encoding)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## API versions

- The `apiVersion` field corresponds to an *API group*

- It can be either `v1` (aka "core" group or "legacy group"), or `group/versions`; e.g.:

  - `apps/v1`
  - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`
  - `extensions/v1beta1`

- It does not indicate which version of Kubernetes we're talking about

- It *indirectly* indicates the version of the `kind`

  (which fields exist, their format, which ones are mandatory...)

- A single resource type (`kind`) is rarely versioned alone

  (e.g.: the `batch` API group contains `jobs` and `cronjobs`)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Update

- Let's update our namespace object

- There are many ways to do that, including:

  - `kubectl apply` (and provide an updated YAML file)
  - `kubectl edit`
  - `kubectl patch`
  - many helpers, like `kubectl label`, or `kubectl set`

- In each case, `kubectl` will:

  - get the current definition of the object
  - compute changes
  - submit the changes (with `PATCH` requests)

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Adding a label

- For demonstration purposes, let's add a label to the namespace

- The easiest way is to use `kubectl label`

.exercise[

- In one terminal, watch namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces --show-labels -w
  ```

- In the other, update our namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl label namespaces hello color=purple
  ```

]

We demonstrated *update* and *watch* semantics.

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## What's special about *watch*?

- The API server itself doesn't do anything: it's just a fancy object store

- All the actual logic in Kubernetes is implemented with *controllers*

- A *controller* watches a set of resources, and takes action when they change

- Examples:

  - when a Pod object is created, it gets scheduled and started

  - when a Pod belonging to a ReplicaSet terminates, it gets replaced

  - when a Deployment object is updated, it can trigger a rolling update

# Other control plane components

- API server ✔️

- etcd ✔️

- Controller manager

- Scheduler

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Controller manager

- This is a collection of loops watching all kinds of objects

- That's where the actual logic of Kubernetes lives

- When we create a Deployment (e.g. with `kubectl run web --image=nginx`),

  - we create a Deployment object

  - the Deployment controller notices it, and creates a ReplicaSet

  - the ReplicaSet controller notices the ReplicaSet, and creates a Pod

.debug[[k8s/architecture.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/architecture.md)]
---

## Scheduler

- When a pod is created, it is in `Pending` state

- The scheduler (or rather: *a scheduler*) must bind it to a node

  - Kubernetes comes with an efficient scheduler with many features

  - if we have special requirements, we can add another scheduler
    <br/>
    (example: this [demo scheduler](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/scheduler) uses the cost of nodes, stored in node annotations)

- A pod might stay in `Pending` state for a long time:

  - if the cluster is full

  - if the pod has special constraints that can't be met

  - if the scheduler is not running (!)

# Building our own cluster

- Let's build our own cluster!

  *Perfection is attained not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. (Antoine de Saint-Exupery)*

- Our goal is to build a minimal cluster allowing us to:

  - create a Deployment (with `kubectl run` or `kubectl create deployment`)
  - expose it with a Service
  - connect to that service


- "Minimal" here means:

  - smaller number of components
  - smaller number of command-line flags
  - smaller number of configuration files

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Non-goals

- For now, we don't care about security

- For now, we don't care about scalability

- For now, we don't care about high availability

- All we care about is *simplicity*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Our environment

- We will use the machine indicated as `dmuc1`

  (this stands for "Dessine Moi Un Cluster" or "Draw Me A Sheep",
  <br/>in homage to Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince")

- This machine:

  - runs Ubuntu LTS

  - has Kubernetes, Docker, and etcd binaries installed

  - but nothing is running

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our environment

- Let's make sure we have everything we need first

.exercise[

- Log into the `dmuc1` machine

- Get root:
  ```bash
  sudo -i
  ```

- Check available versions:
  ```bash
  etcd -version
  kube-apiserver --version
  dockerd --version
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## The plan

1. Start API server

2. Interact with it (create Deployment and Service)

3. See what's broken

4. Fix it and go back to step 2 until it works!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Dealing with multiple processes

- We are going to start many processes

- Depending on what you're comfortable with, you can:

  - open multiple windows and multiple SSH connections

  - use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux

  - put processes in the background with `&`
    <br/>(warning: log output might get confusing to read!)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting API server

.exercise[

- Try to start the API server:
  ```bash
  kube-apiserver
  # It will fail with "--etcd-servers must be specified"
  ```

]

Since the API server stores everything in etcd,
it cannot start without it.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting etcd

.exercise[

- Try to start etcd:
  ```bash
  etcd
  ```

]

Success!

Note the last line of output:
```
serving insecure client requests on 127.0.0.1:2379, this is strongly discouraged!
```

*Sure, that's discouraged. But thanks for telling us the address!*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting API server (for real)

- Try again, passing the `--etcd-servers` argument

- That argument should be a comma-separated list of URLs

.exercise[

- Start API server:
  ```bash
  kube-apiserver --etcd-servers http://127.0.0.1:2379
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Interacting with API server

- Let's try a few "classic" commands

.exercise[

- List nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- List services:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```

]

We should get `No resources found.` and the `kubernetes` service, respectively.

Note: the API server automatically created the `kubernetes` service entry.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about `kubeconfig`?

- We didn't need to create a `kubeconfig` file

- By default, the API server is listening on `localhost:8080`

  (without requiring authentication)

- By default, `kubectl` connects to `localhost:8080`

  (without providing authentication)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Creating a Deployment

- Let's run a web server!

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment with NGINX:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

]

Success?

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our Deployment status

.exercise[

- Look at pods, deployments, etc.:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Our Deployment is in bad shape:
```
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/web   0/1     0            0           2m26s
```

And, there is no ReplicaSet, and no Pod.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- We stored the definition of our Deployment in etcd

  (through the API server)

- But there is no *controller* to do the rest of the work

- We need to start the *controller manager*

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the controller manager

.exercise[

- Try to start the controller manager:
  ```bash
  kube-controller-manager
  ```

]

The final error message is:
```
invalid configuration: no configuration has been provided
```

But the logs include another useful piece of information:
```
Neither --kubeconfig nor --master was specified.
Using the inClusterConfig.  This might not work.
```

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Reminder: everyone talks to API server

- The controller manager needs to connect to the API server

- It *does not* have a convenient `localhost:8080` default

- We can pass the connection information in two ways:

  - `--master` and a host:port combination (easy)

  - `--kubeconfig` and a `kubeconfig` file

- For simplicity, we'll use the first option

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the controller manager (for real)

.exercise[

- Start the controller manager:
  ```bash
  kube-controller-manager --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking our Deployment status

.exercise[

- Check all our resources again:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

We now have a ReplicaSet.

But we still don't have a Pod.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's going on?

In the controller manager logs, we should see something like this:
```
E0404 15:46:25.753376   22847 replica_set.go:450] Sync "default/web-5bc9bd5b8d"
failed with `No API token found for service account "default"`, retry after the
token is automatically created and added to the service account
```

- The service account `default` was automatically added to our Deployment

  (and to its pods)

- The service account `default` exists

- But it doesn't have an associated token

  (the token is a secret; creating it requires signature; therefore a CA)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Solving the missing token issue

There are many ways to solve that issue.

We are going to list a few (to get an idea of what's happening behind the scenes).

Of course, we don't need to perform *all* the solutions mentioned here.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 1: disable service accounts

- Restart the API server with
  `--disable-admission-plugins=ServiceAccount`

- The API server will no longer add a service account automatically

- Our pods will be created without a service account

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 2: do not mount the (missing) token

- Add `automountServiceAccountToken: false` to the Deployment spec

  *or*

- Add `automountServiceAccountToken: false` to the default ServiceAccount

- The ReplicaSet controller will no longer create pods referencing the (missing) token

.exercise[

- Programmatically change the `default` ServiceAccount:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch sa default -p "automountServiceAccountToken: false"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Option 3: set up service accounts properly

- This is the most complex option!

- Generate a key pair

- Pass the private key to the controller manager

  (to generate and sign tokens)

- Pass the public key to the API server

  (to verify these tokens)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Continuing without service account token

- Once we patch the default service account, the ReplicaSet can create a Pod

.exercise[

- Check that we now have a pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Note: we might have to wait a bit for the ReplicaSet controller to retry.

If we're impatient, we can restart the controller manager.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## What's next?

- Our pod exists, but it is in `Pending` state

- Remember, we don't have a node so far

  (`kubectl get nodes` shows an empty list)

- We need to:

  - start a container engine

  - start kubelet

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting a container engine

- We're going to use Docker (because it's the default option)

.exercise[

- Start the Docker Engine:
  ```bash
  dockerd
  ```

]

Success!

Feel free to check that it actually works with e.g.:
```bash
docker run alpine echo hello world
```

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- If we start kubelet without arguments, it *will* start

- But it will not join the cluster!

- It will start in *standalone* mode

- Just like with the controller manager, we need to tell kubelet where the API server is

- Alas, kubelet doesn't have a simple `--master` option

- We have to use `--kubeconfig`

- We need to write a `kubeconfig` file for kubelet

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Writing a kubeconfig file

- We can copy/paste a bunch of YAML

- Or we can generate the file with `kubectl`

.exercise[

- Create the file `kubeconfig.kubelet` with `kubectl`:
  ```bash
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            set-cluster localhost --server http://localhost:8080
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            set-context localhost --cluster localhost
    kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet config \
            use-context localhost
  ```

]

---

## All Kubernetes clients can use `kubeconfig`

- The `kubeconfig.kubelet` file has the same format as e.g. `~/.kubeconfig`

- All Kubernetes clients can use a similar file

- The `kubectl config` commands can be used to manipulate these files

- This highlights that kubelet is a "normal" client of the API server

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Our `kubeconfig.kubelet` file

The file that we generated looks like the one below.

That one has been slightly simplified (removing extraneous fields), but it is still valid.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
current-context: localhost
contexts:
- name: localhost
  context:
    cluster: localhost
clusters:
- name: localhost
  cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
```

## Starting kubelet

.exercise[

- Start kubelet with that `kubeconfig.kubelet` file:
  ```bash
  kubelet --kubeconfig kubeconfig.kubelet
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]

## Looking at our 1-node cluster

- Let's check that our node registered correctly

.exercise[

- List the nodes in our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

Our node should show up.

Its name will be its hostname (it should be `dmuc1`).

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Are we there yet?

- Let's check if our pod is running

.exercise[

- List all resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

--

Our pod is still `Pending`. 🤔

--

Which is normal: it needs to be *scheduled*.

(i.e., something needs to decide which node it should go on.)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Scheduling our pod

- Why do we need a scheduling decision, since we have only one node?

- The node might be full, unavailable; the pod might have constraints ...

- The easiest way to schedule our pod is to start the scheduler

  (we could also schedule it manually)

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting the scheduler

- The scheduler also needs to know how to connect to the API server

- Just like for controller manager, we can use `--kubeconfig` or `--master`

.exercise[

- Start the scheduler:
  ```bash
  kube-scheduler --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

- Our pod should now start correctly

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Checking the status of our pod

- Our pod will go through a short `ContainerCreating` phase

- Then it will be `Running`

.exercise[

- Check pod status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]

class: extra-details

## Scheduling a pod manually

- We can schedule a pod in `Pending` state by creating a Binding, e.g.:
  ```bash
    kubectl create -f- <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Binding
    metadata:
      name: name-of-the-pod
    target:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Node
      name: name-of-the-node
    EOF
  ```

- This is actually how the scheduler works!

- It watches pods, makes scheduling decisions, and creates Binding objects

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Connecting to our pod

- Let's check that our pod correctly runs NGINX

.exercise[

- Check our pod's IP address:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

- Send some HTTP request to the pod:
  ```bash
  curl `X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

We should see the `Welcome to nginx!` page.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Exposing our Deployment

- We can now create a Service associated with this Deployment

.exercise[

- Expose the Deployment's port 80:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
  ```

- Check the Service's ClusterIP, and try connecting:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service web
  curl http://`X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

--

This won't work. We need kube-proxy to enable internal communication.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Starting kube-proxy

- kube-proxy also needs to connect to the API server

- It can work with the `--master` flag

  (although that will be deprecated in the future)

.exercise[

- Start kube-proxy:
  ```bash
  kube-proxy --master http://localhost:8080
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

## Connecting to our Service

- Now that kube-proxy is running, we should be able to connect

.exercise[

- Check the Service's ClusterIP again, and retry connecting:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service web
  curl http://`X.X.X.X`
  ```

]

Success!

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]

class: extra-details

## How kube-proxy works

- kube-proxy watches Service resources

- When a Service is created or updated, kube-proxy creates iptables rules

.exercise[

- Check out the `OUTPUT` chain in the `nat` table:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L OUTPUT
  ```

- Traffic is sent to `KUBE-SERVICES`; check that too:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SERVICES
  ```

]

For each Service, there is an entry in that chain.

.debug[[k8s/dmuc.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/dmuc.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Diving into iptables

- The last command showed a chain named `KUBE-SVC-...` corresponding to our service

.exercise[

- Check that `KUBE-SVC-...` chain:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L `KUBE-SVC-...`
  ```

- It should show a jump to a `KUBE-SEP-...` chains; check it out too:
  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -L `KUBE-SEP-...`
  ```

]

This is a `DNAT` rule to rewrite the destination address of the connection to our pod.

This is how kube-proxy works!

## kube-router, IPVS

- With recent versions of Kubernetes, it is possible to tell kube-proxy to use IPVS

- IPVS is a more powerful load balancing framework

  (remember: iptables was primarily designed for firewalling, not load balancing!)

- It is also possible to replace kube-proxy with kube-router

- kube-router uses IPVS by default

- kube-router can also perform other functions

  (e.g., we can use it as a CNI plugin to provide pod connectivity)

class: extra-details

## What about the `kubernetes` service?

- If we try to connect, it won't work

  (by default, it should be `10.0.0.1`)

- If we look at the Endpoints for this service, we will see one endpoint:

  `host-address:6443`

- By default, the API server expects to be running directly on the nodes

  (it could be as a bare process, or in a container/pod using the host network)

- ... And it expects to be listening on port 6443 with TLS

# Adding nodes to the cluster

- So far, our cluster has only 1 node

- Let's see what it takes to add more nodes

- We are going to use another set of machines: `kubenet`

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## The environment

- We have 3 identical machines: `kubenet1`, `kubenet2`, `kubenet3`

- The Docker Engine is installed (and running) on these machines

- The Kubernetes packages are installed, but nothing is running

- We will use `kubenet1` to run the control plane

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## The plan

- Start the control plane on `kubenet1`

- Join the 3 nodes to the cluster

- Deploy and scale a simple web server

.exercise[

- Log into `kubenet1`

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Running the control plane

- We will use a Compose file to start the control plane components

.exercise[

- Clone the repository containing the workshop materials:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

- Go to the `compose/simple-k8s-control-plane` directory:
  ```bash
  cd container.training/compose/simple-k8s-control-plane
  ```

- Start the control plane:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Checking the control plane status

- Before moving on, verify that the control plane works

.exercise[

- Show control plane component statuses:
  ```bash
  kubectl get componentstatuses
  kubectl get cs
  ```

- Show the (empty) list of nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

class: extra-details

## Differences from `dmuc`

- Our new control plane listens on `0.0.0.0` instead of the default `127.0.0.1`

- The ServiceAccount admission plugin is disabled

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Joining the nodes

- We need to generate a `kubeconfig` file for kubelet

- This time, we need to put the public IP address of `kubenet1`

  (instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)

.exercise[

- Generate the `kubeconfig` file:
  ```bash
    kubectl config set-cluster kubenet --server http://`X.X.X.X`:8080
    kubectl config set-context kubenet --cluster kubenet
    kubectl config use-context kubenet
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Distributing the `kubeconfig` file

- We need that `kubeconfig` file on the other nodes, too

.exercise[

- Copy `kubeconfig` to the other nodes:
  ```bash
    for N in 2 3; do
    	scp ~/kubeconfig kubenet$N:
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- Reminder: kubelet needs to run as root; don't forget `sudo`!

.exercise[

- Join the first node:
   ```bash
   sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
   ```

- Open more terminals and join the other nodes to the cluster:
  ```bash
  ssh kubenet2 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ssh kubenet3 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Checking cluster status

- We should now see all 3 nodes

- At first, their `STATUS` will be `NotReady`

- They will move to `Ready` state after approximately 10 seconds

.exercise[

- Check the list of nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Deploy a web server

- Let's create a Deployment and scale it

  (so that we have multiple pods on multiple nodes)

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment running NGINX:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx
  ```

- Scale it:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Check our pods

- The pods will be scheduled on the nodes

- The nodes will pull the `nginx` image, and start the pods

- What are the IP addresses of our pods?

.exercise[

- Check the IP addresses of our pods
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

--

🤔 Something's not right ... Some pods have the same IP address!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What's going on?

- On a normal cluster, kubelet is configured to set up pod networking with CNI plugins

- This requires:

  - installing CNI plugins

  - writing CNI configuration files

  - running kubelet with `--network-plugin=cni`

- Without the `--network-plugin` flag, kubelet defaults to "no-op" networking

- It lets the container engine use a default network

  (in that case, we end up with the default Docker bridge)

- Our pods are running on independent, disconnected, host-local networks

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Using network plugins

- We need to set up a better network

- Before diving into CNI, we will use the `kubenet` plugin

- This plugin creates a `cbr0` bridge and connects the containers to that bridge

- This plugin allocates IP addresses from a range:

  - either specified to kubelet (e.g. with `--pod-cidr`)

  - or stored in the node's `spec.podCIDR` field

.footnote[See [here] for more details about this `kubenet` plugin.]

[here]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#kubenet

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What `kubenet` does and *does not* do

- It allocates IP addresses to pods *locally*

  (each node has its own local subnet)

- It connects the pods to a *local* bridge

  (pods on the same node can communicate together; not with other nodes)

- It doesn't set up routing or tunneling

  (we get pods on separated networks; we need to connect them somehow)

- It doesn't allocate subnets to nodes

  (this can be done manually, or by the controller manager) 

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Setting up routing or tunneling

- *On each node*, we will add routes to the other nodes' pod network

- Of course, this is not convenient or scalable!

- We will see better techniques to do this; but for now, hang on!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Allocating subnets to nodes

- There are multiple options:

  - passing the subnet to kubelet with the `--pod-cidr` flag

  - manually setting `spec.podCIDR` on each node

  - allocating node CIDRs automatically with the controller manager

- The last option would be implemented by adding these flags to controller manager:
  ```
  --allocate-node-cidrs=true --cluster-cidr=<cidr> 
  ```

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## The pod CIDR field is not mandatory

- `kubenet` needs the pod CIDR, but other plugins don't need it

  (e.g. because they allocate addresses in multiple pools, or a single big one)

- The pod CIDR field may eventually be deprecated and replaced by an annotation

  (see [kubernetes/kubernetes#57130](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57130))

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Restarting kubelet wih pod CIDR

- We need to stop and restart all our kubelets

- We will add the `--network-plugin` and `--pod-cidr` flags

- We all have a "cluster number" (let's call that `C`) printed on your VM info card

- We will use pod CIDR `10.C.N.0/24` (where `N` is the node number: 1, 2, 3)

.exercise[

- Stop all the kubelets (Ctrl-C is fine)

- Restart them all, adding `--network-plugin=kubenet --pod-cidr 10.C.N.0/24`

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What happens to our pods?

- When we stop (or kill) kubelet, the containers keep running

- When kubelet starts again, it detects the containers

.exercise[

- Check that our pods are still here:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

]

🤔 But our pods still use local IP addresses!

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Recreating the pods

- The IP address of a pod cannot change

- kubelet doesn't automatically kill/restart containers with "invalid" addresses
  <br/>
  (in fact, from kubelet's point of view, there is no such thing as an "invalid" address)

- We must delete our pods and recreate them

.exercise[

- Delete all the pods, and let the ReplicaSet recreate them:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pods --all
  ```

- Wait for the pods to be up again:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Adding kube-proxy

- Let's start kube-proxy to provide internal load balancing

- Then see if we can create a Service and use it to contact our pods

.exercise[

- Start kube-proxy:
  ```bash
  sudo kube-proxy --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig
  ```

- Expose our Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Test internal load balancing

.exercise[

- Retrieve the ClusterIP address:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc web
  ```

- Send a few requests to the ClusterIP address (with `curl`)

]

--

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Why?

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Routing traffic

- Our pods have new, distinct IP addresses

- But they are on host-local, isolated networks

- If we try to ping a pod on a different node, it won't work

- kube-proxy merely rewrites the destination IP address

- But we need that IP address to be reachable in the first place

- How do we fix this?

  (hint: check the title of this slide!)

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Important warning

- The technique that we are about to use doesn't work everywhere

- It only works if:

  - all the nodes are directly connected to each other (at layer 2)

  - the underlying network allows the IP addresses of our pods

- If we are on physical machines connected by a switch: OK

- If we are on virtual machines in a public cloud: NOT OK

  - on AWS, we need to disable "source and destination checks" on our instances

  - on OpenStack, we need to disable "port security" on our network ports

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Routing basics

- We need to tell *each* node:

  "The subnet 10.C.N.0/24 is located on node N" (for all values of N)

- This is how we add a route on Linux:
  ```bash
  ip route add 10.C.N.0/24 via W.X.Y.Z
  ```

  (where `W.X.Y.Z` is the internal IP address of node N)

- We can see the internal IP addresses of our nodes with:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Firewalling

- By default, Docker prevents containers from using arbitrary IP addresses

  (by setting up iptables rules)

- We need to allow our containers to use our pod CIDR

- For simplicity, we will insert a blanket iptables rule allowing all traffic:

  `iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCEPT`

- This has to be done on every node

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## Setting up routing

.exercise[

- Create all the routes on all the nodes

- Insert the iptables rule allowing traffic

- Check that you can ping all the pods from one of the nodes

- Check that you can `curl` the ClusterIP of the Service successfully

]

.debug[[k8s/multinode.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/multinode.md)]
---

## What's next?

- We did a lot of manual operations:

  - allocating subnets to nodes

  - adding command-line flags to kubelet

  - updating the routing tables on our nodes

- We want to automate all these steps

- We want something that works on all networks

# The Container Network Interface

- Allows us to decouple network configuration from Kubernetes

- Implemented by *plugins*

- Plugins are executables that will be invoked by kubelet

- Plugins are responsible for:

  - allocating IP addresses for containers

  - configuring the network for containers

- Plugins can be combined and chained when it makes sense

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Combining plugins

- Interface could be created by e.g. `vlan` or `bridge` plugin

- IP address could be allocated by e.g. `dhcp` or `host-local` plugin

- Interface parameters (MTU, sysctls) could be tweaked by the `tuning` plugin

The reference plugins are available [here].

Look in each plugin's directory for its documentation.

[here]: https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## How does kubelet know which plugins to use?

- The plugin (or list of plugins) is set in the CNI configuration

- The CNI configuration is a *single file* in `/etc/cni/net.d`

- If there are multiple files in that directory, the first one is used

  (in lexicographic order)

- That path can be changed with the `--cni-conf-dir` flag of kubelet

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## CNI configuration in practice

- When we set up the "pod network" (like Calico, Weave...) it ships a CNI configuration

  (and sometimes, custom CNI plugins)

- Very often, that configuration (and plugins) is installed automatically

  (by a DaemonSet featuring an initContainer with hostPath volumes)

- Examples:

  - Calico [CNI config](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/1372b56e3bfebe2b9c9cbf8105d6a14764f44159/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml#L25)
    and [volume](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/blob/1372b56e3bfebe2b9c9cbf8105d6a14764f44159/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml#L219)

  - kube-router [CNI config](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/c2f893f64fd60cf6d2b6d3fee7191266c0fc0fe5/daemonset/generic-kuberouter.yaml#L10)
    and [volume](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/c2f893f64fd60cf6d2b6d3fee7191266c0fc0fe5/daemonset/generic-kuberouter.yaml#L73)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Conf vs conflist

- There are two slightly different configuration formats

- Basic configuration format:

  - holds configuration for a single plugin
  - typically has a `.conf` name suffix
  - has a `type` string field in the top-most structure
  - [examples](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#example-configurations)

- Configuration list format:

  - can hold configuration for multiple (chained) plugins
  - typically has a `.conflist` name suffix
  - has a `plugins` list field in the top-most structure
  - [examples](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md#network-configuration-lists)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## How plugins are invoked

- Parameters are given through environment variables, including:

  - CNI_COMMAND: desired operation (ADD, DEL, CHECK, or VERSION)

  - CNI_CONTAINERID: container ID

  - CNI_NETNS: path to network namespace file

  - CNI_IFNAME: what the network interface should be named

- The network configuration must be provided to the plugin on stdin

  (this avoids race conditions that could happen by passing a file path)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## In practice: kube-router

- We are going to set up a new cluster

- For this new cluster, we will use kube-router

- kube-router will provide the "pod network"

  (connectivity with pods)

- kube-router will also provide internal service connectivity

  (replacing kube-proxy)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## How kube-router works

- Very simple architecture

- Does not introduce new CNI plugins

  (uses the `bridge` plugin, with `host-local` for IPAM)

- Pod traffic is routed between nodes

  (no tunnel, no new protocol)

- Internal service connectivity is implemented with IPVS

- Can provide pod network and/or internal service connectivity

- kube-router daemon runs on every node

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## What kube-router does

- Connect to the API server

- Obtain the local node's `podCIDR`

- Inject it into the CNI configuration file

  (we'll use `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conflist`)

- Obtain the addresses of all nodes

- Establish a *full mesh* BGP peering with the other nodes

- Exchange routes over BGP

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## What's BGP?

- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol used between internet routers

- It [scales](https://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/)
  pretty [well](https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/plota?file=%2fvar%2fdata%2fbgp%2fas2.0%2fbgp-active%2etxt&descr=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&ylabel=Active%20BGP%20entries%20%28FIB%29&with=step)
  (it is used to announce the 700k CIDR prefixes of the internet)

- It is spoken by many hardware routers from many vendors

- It also has many software implementations (Quagga, Bird, FRR...)

- Experienced network folks generally know it (and appreciate it)

- It also used by Calico (another popular network system for Kubernetes)

- Using BGP allows us to interconnect our "pod network" with other systems

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## The plan

- We'll work in a new cluster (named `kuberouter`)

- We will run a simple control plane (like before)

- ... But this time, the controller manager will allocate `podCIDR` subnets

  (so that we don't have to manually assign subnets to individual nodes)

- We will create a DaemonSet for kube-router

- We will join nodes to the cluster

- The DaemonSet will automatically start a kube-router pod on each node

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Logging into the new cluster

.exercise[

- Log into node `kuberouter1`

- Clone the workshop repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training
  ```

- Move to this directory:
  ```bash
  cd container.training/compose/kube-router-k8s-control-plane
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Our control plane

- We will use a Compose file to start the control plane

- It is similar to the one we used with the `kubenet` cluster

- The API server is started with `--allow-privileged`

  (because we will start kube-router in privileged pods)

- The controller manager is started with extra flags too:

  `--allocate-node-cidrs` and `--cluster-cidr`

- We need to edit the Compose file to set the Cluster CIDR

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting the control plane

- Our cluster CIDR will be `10.C.0.0/16`

  (where `C` is our cluster number)

.exercise[

- Edit the Compose file to set the Cluster CIDR:
  ```bash
  vim docker-compose.yaml
  ```

- Start the control plane:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

## The kube-router DaemonSet

- In the same directory, there is a `kuberouter.yaml` file

- It contains the definition for a DaemonSet and a ConfigMap

- Before we load it, we also need to edit it

- We need to indicate the address of the API server

  (because kube-router needs to connect to it to retrieve node information)

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Creating the DaemonSet

- The address of the API server will be `http://A.B.C.D:8080`

  (where `A.B.C.D` is the public address of `kuberouter1`, running the control plane)

.exercise[

- Edit the YAML file to set the API server address:
  ```bash
  vim kuberouter.yaml
  ```

- Create the DaemonSet:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f kuberouter.yaml
  ```

]

Note: the DaemonSet won't create any pods (yet) since there are no nodes (yet).

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Generating the kubeconfig for kubelet

- This is similar to what we did for the `kubenet` cluster

.exercise[

- Generate the kubeconfig file (replacing `X.X.X.X` with the address of `kuberouter1`):
  ```bash
    kubectl config set-cluster cni --server http://`X.X.X.X`:8080
    kubectl config set-context cni --cluster cni
    kubectl config use-context cni
    cp ~/.kube/config ~/kubeconfig
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Distributing kubeconfig

- We need to copy that kubeconfig file to the other nodes

.exercise[

- Copy `kubeconfig` to the other nodes:
  ```bash
    for N in 2 3; do
    	scp ~/kubeconfig kuberouter$N:
    done
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting kubelet

- We don't need the `--pod-cidr` option anymore

  (the controller manager will allocate these automatically)

- We need to pass `--network-plugin=cni`

.exercise[

- Join the first node:
   ```bash
   sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
   ```

- Open more terminals and join the other nodes:
  ```bash
  ssh kuberouter2 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
  ssh kuberouter3 sudo kubelet --kubeconfig ~/kubeconfig --network-plugin=cni
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Setting up a test

- Let's create a Deployment and expose it with a Service

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment running a web server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment web --image=jpetazzo/httpenv
  ```

- Scale it so that it spans multiple nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=5
  ```

- Expose it with a Service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment web --port=8888
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Checking that everything works

.exercise[

- Get the ClusterIP address for the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc web
  ```

- Send a few requests there:
  ```bash
  curl `X.X.X.X`:8888
  ```

]

Note that if you send multiple requests, they are load-balanced in a round robin manner.

This shows that we are using IPVS (vs. iptables, which picked random endpoints).

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Troubleshooting

- What if we need to check that everything is working properly?

.exercise[

- Check the IP addresses of our pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

- Check our routing table:
  ```bash
  route -n
  ip route
  ```

]

We should see the local pod CIDR connected to `kube-bridge`, and the other nodes' pod CIDRs having individual routes, with each node being the gateway.

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## More troubleshooting

- We can also look at the output of the kube-router pods

  (with `kubectl logs`)

- kube-router also comes with a special shell that gives lots of useful info

  (we can access it with `kubectl exec`)

- But with the current setup of the cluster, these options may not work!

- Why?

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Trying `kubectl logs` / `kubectl exec`

.exercise[

- Try to show the logs of a kube-router pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system logs ds/kube-router
  ```

- Or try to exec into one of the kube-router pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-system exec kube-router-xxxxx bash
  ```

]

These commands will give an error message that includes:
```
dial tcp: lookup kuberouterX on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host
```

What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Internal name resolution

- To execute these commands, the API server needs to connect to kubelet

- By default, it creates a connection using the kubelet's name

  (e.g. `http://kuberouter1:...`)

- This requires our nodes names to be in DNS

- We can change that by setting a flag on the API server:

  `--kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP`

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Another way to check the logs

- We can also ask the logs directly to the container engine

- First, get the container ID, with `docker ps` or like this:
  ```bash
  CID=$(docker ps -q \
        --filter label=io.kubernetes.pod.namespace=kube-system \
        --filter label=io.kubernetes.container.name=kube-router)
  ```

- Then view the logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs $CID
  ```

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Other ways to distribute routing tables

- We don't need kube-router and BGP to distribute routes

- The list of nodes (and associated `podCIDR` subnets) is available through the API

- This shell snippet generates the commands to add all required routes on a node:

```bash
NODES=$(kubectl get nodes -o name | cut -d/ -f2)
for DESTNODE in $NODES; do
  if [ "$DESTNODE" != "$HOSTNAME" ]; then
    echo $(kubectl get node $DESTNODE -o go-template="
      route add -net {{.spec.podCIDR}} gw {{(index .status.addresses 0).address}}")
  fi
done
```

- This could be useful for embedded platforms with very limited resources

  (or lab environments for learning purposes)

# Interconnecting clusters

- We assigned different Cluster CIDRs to each cluster

- This allows us to connect our clusters together

- We will leverage kube-router BGP abilities for that

- We will *peer* each kube-router instance with a *route reflector*

- As a result, we will be able to ping each other's pods

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Disclaimers

- There are many methods to interconnect clusters

- Depending on your network implementation, you will use different methods

- The method shown here only works for nodes with direct layer 2 connection

- We will often need to use tunnels or other network techniques

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## The plan

- Someone will start the *route reflector*

  (typically, that will be the person presenting these slides!)

- We will update our kube-router configuration

- We will add a *peering* with the route reflector

  (instructing kube-router to connect to it and exchange route information)

- We should see the routes to other clusters on our nodes

  (in the output of e.g. `route -n` or `ip route show`)

- We should be able to ping pods of other nodes

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Starting the route reflector

- Only do this slide if you are doing this on your own

- There is a Compose file in the `compose/frr-route-reflector` directory

- Before continuing, make sure that you have the IP address of the route reflector

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Configuring kube-router

- This can be done in two ways:

  - with command-line flags to the `kube-router` process

  - with annotations to Node objects

- We will use the command-line flags

  (because it will automatically propagate to all nodes)

.footnote[Note: with Calico, this is achieved by creating a BGPPeer CRD.]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Updating kube-router configuration

- We need to pass two command-line flags to the kube-router process

.exercise[

- Edit the `kuberouter.yaml` file

- Add the following flags to the kube-router arguments:
  ```
  - "--peer-router-ips=`X.X.X.X`"
  - "--peer-router-asns=64512"
  ```
  (Replace `X.X.X.X` with the route reflector address)

- Update the DaemonSet definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f kuberouter.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Restarting kube-router

- The DaemonSet will not update the pods automatically

  (it is using the default `updateStrategy`, which is `OnDelete`)

- We will therefore delete the pods

  (they will be recreated with the updated definition)

.exercise[

- Delete all the kube-router pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-router
  ```

]

Note: the other `updateStrategy` for a DaemonSet is RollingUpdate.
<br/>
For critical services, we might want to precisely control the update process.

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## Checking peering status

- We can see informative messages in the output of kube-router:
  ```
  time="2019-04-07T15:53:56Z" level=info msg="Peer Up"
  Key=X.X.X.X State=BGP_FSM_OPENCONFIRM Topic=Peer
  ```

- We should see the routes of the other clusters show up

- For debugging purposes, the reflector also exports a route to 1.0.0.2/32

- That route will show up like this:
  ```
  1.0.0.2     172.31.X.Y    255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
  ```

- We should be able to ping the pods of other clusters!

.debug[[k8s/cni.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cni.md)]
---

## If we wanted to do more ...

- kube-router can also export ClusterIP addresses

  (by adding the flag `--advertise-cluster-ip`)

- They are exported individually (as /32)

- This would allow us to easily access other clusters' services

  (without having to resolve the individual addresses of pods)

- Even better if it's combined with DNS integration

  (to facilitate name → ClusterIP resolution)

# Extending the Kubernetes API

There are multiple ways to extend the Kubernetes API.

We are going to cover:

- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- Admission Webhooks

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Revisiting the API server

- The Kubernetes API server is a central point of the control plane

  (everything connects to it: controller manager, scheduler, kubelets)

- Almost everything in Kubernetes is materialized by a resource

- Resources have a type (or "kind")

  (similar to strongly typed languages)

- We can see existing types with `kubectl api-resources`

- We can list resources of a given type with `kubectl get <type>`

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Creating new types

- We can create new types with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- CRDs are created dynamically

  (without recompiling or restarting the API server)

- CRDs themselves are resources:

  - we can create a new type with `kubectl create` and some YAML

  - we can see all our custom types with `kubectl get crds`

- After we create a CRD, the new type works just like built-in types

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## What can we do with CRDs?

There are many possibilities!

- *Operators* encapsulate complex sets of resources

  (e.g.: a PostgreSQL replicated cluster; an etcd cluster...
  <br/>
  see [awesome operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/awesome-operators) and
  [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/) to find more)

- Custom use-cases like [gitkube](https://gitkube.sh/)

  - creates a new custom type, `Remote`, exposing a git+ssh server

  - deploy by pushing YAML or Helm charts to that remote

- Replacing built-in types with CRDs

  (see [this lightning talk by Tim Hockin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji0FWzFwNhA&index=2&list=PLj6h78yzYM2PZf9eA7bhWnIh_mK1vyOfU))

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Little details

- By default, CRDs are not *validated*

  (we can put anything we want in the `spec`)

- When creating a CRD, we can pass an OpenAPI v3 schema (BETA!)

  (which will then be used to validate resources)

- Generally, when creating a CRD, we also want to run a *controller*

  (otherwise nothing will happen when we create resources of that type) 

- The controller will typically *watch* our custom resources

  (and take action when they are created/updated)

*
Examples:
[YAML to install the gitkube CRD](https://storage.googleapis.com/gitkube/gitkube-setup-stable.yaml),
[YAML to install a redis operator CRD](https://github.com/amaizfinance/redis-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/k8s_v1alpha1_redis_crd.yaml)
*

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Service catalog

- *Service catalog* is another extension mechanism

- It's not extending the Kubernetes API strictly speaking

  (but it still provides new features!)

- It doesn't create new types; it uses:

  - ClusterServiceBroker
  - ClusterServiceClass
  - ClusterServicePlan
  - ServiceInstance
  - ServiceBinding 

- It uses the Open service broker API

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission controllers

- When a Pod is created, it is associated with a ServiceAccount

  (even if we did not specify one explicitly)

- That ServiceAccount was added on the fly by an *admission controller*

  (specifically, a *mutating admission controller*)

- Admission controllers sit on the API request path

  (see the cool diagram on next slide, courtesy of Banzai Cloud)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission controllers

- *Validating* admission controllers can accept/reject the API call

- *Mutating* admission controllers can modify the API request payload

- Both types can also trigger additional actions

  (e.g. automatically create a Namespace if it doesn't exist)

- There are a number of built-in admission controllers

  (see [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#what-does-each-admission-controller-do) for a list)

- But we can also define our own!

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Admission Webhooks

- We can setup *admission webhooks* to extend the behavior of the API server

- The API server will submit incoming API requests to these webhooks

- These webhooks can be *validating* or *mutating*

- Webhooks can be set up dynamically (without restarting the API server)

- To setup a dynamic admission webhook, we create a special resource:

  a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` or a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`

- These resources are created and managed like other resources

  (i.e. `kubectl create`, `kubectl get`...)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## Webhook Configuration

- A ValidatingWebhookConfiguration or MutatingWebhookConfiguration contains:

  - the address of the webhook

  - the authentication information to use with the webhook

  - a list of rules

- The rules indicate for which objects and actions the webhook is triggered

  (to avoid e.g. triggering webhooks when setting up webhooks)

.debug[[k8s/extending-api.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/extending-api.md)]
---

## (Ab)using the API server

- If we need to store something "safely" (as in: in etcd), we can use CRDs

- This gives us primitives to read/write/list objects (and optionally validate them)

- The Kubernetes API server can run on its own

  (without the scheduler, controller manager, and kubelets)

- By loading CRDs, we can have it manage totally different objects

  (unrelated to containers, clusters, etc.)

# Operators

- Operators are one of the many ways to extend Kubernetes

- We will define operators

- We will see how they work

- We will install a specific operator (for ElasticSearch)

- We will use it to provision an ElasticSearch cluster

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## What are operators?

*An operator represents **human operational knowledge in software,**
<br/>
to reliably manage an application.
— [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html)*

Examples:

- Deploying and configuring replication with MySQL, PostgreSQL ...

- Setting up Elasticsearch, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper ...

- Reacting to failures when intervention is needed

- Scaling up and down these systems

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## What are they made from?

- Operators combine two things:

  - Custom Resource Definitions

  - controller code watching the corresponding resources and acting upon them

- A given operator can define one or multiple CRDs

- The controller code (control loop) typically runs within the cluster

  (running as a Deployment with 1 replica is a common scenario)

- But it could also run elsewhere

  (nothing mandates that the code run on the cluster, as long as it has API access)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Why use operators?

- Kubernetes gives us Deployments, StatefulSets, Services ...

- These mechanisms give us building blocks to deploy applications

- They work great for services that are made of *N* identical containers

  (like stateless ones)

- They also work great for some stateful applications like Consul, etcd ...

  (with the help of highly persistent volumes)

- They're not enough for complex services:

  - where different containers have different roles

  - where extra steps have to be taken when scaling or replacing containers

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Use-cases for operators

- Systems with primary/secondary replication

  Examples: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis ...

- Systems where different groups of nodes have different roles

  Examples: ElasticSearch, MongoDB ...

- Systems with complex dependencies (that are themselves managed with operators)

  Examples: Flink or Kafka, which both depend on Zookeeper

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## More use-cases

- Representing and managing external resources

  (Example: [AWS Service Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/alpha/aws-service-operator.v0.0.1))

- Managing complex cluster add-ons

  (Example: [Istio operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/beta/istio-operator.0.1.6))

- Deploying and managing our applications' lifecycles

  (more on that later)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## How operators work

- An operator creates one or more CRDs

  (i.e., it creates new "Kinds" of resources on our cluster)

- The operator also runs a *controller* that will watch its resources

- Each time we create/update/delete a resource, the controller is notified

  (we could write our own cheap controller with `kubectl get --watch`)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## One operator in action

- We will install the UPMC Enterprises ElasticSearch operator

- This operator requires PersistentVolumes

- We will install Rancher's [local path storage provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) to automatically create these

- Then, we will create an ElasticSearch resource

- The operator will detect that resource and provision the cluster

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Installing a Persistent Volume provisioner

(This step can be skipped if you already have a dynamic volume provisioner.)

- This provisioner creates Persistent Volumes backed by `hostPath`

  (local directories on our nodes)

- It doesn't require anything special ...

- ... But losing a node = losing the volumes on that node!

- Install the local path storage provisioner:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/local-path-storage.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Making sure we have a default StorageClass

- The ElasticSearch operator will create StatefulSets

- These StatefulSets will instantiate PersistentVolumeClaims

- These PVCs need to be explicitly associated with a StorageClass

- Or we need to tag a StorageClass to be used as the default one

.exercise[

- List StorageClasses:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

]

We should see the `local-path` StorageClass.

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Setting a default StorageClass

- This is done by adding an annotation to the StorageClass:

  `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true`

.exercise[

- Tag the StorageClass so that it's the default one:
  ```bash
  kubectl annotate storageclass local-path \
            storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true
  ```

- Check the result:
  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

]

Now, the StorageClass should have `(default)` next to its name.

---

## Install the ElasticSearch operator

- The operator needs:

  - a Deployment for its controller
  - a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding for permissions
  - a Namespace

- We have grouped all the definitions for these resources in a YAML file

.exercise[

- Install the operator:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-operator.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Wait for the operator to be ready

- Some operators require to create their CRDs separately

- This operator will create its CRD itself

  (i.e. the CRD is not listed in the YAML that we applied earlier)

.exercise[

- Wait until the `elasticsearchclusters` CRD shows up:
  ```bash
  kubectl get crds
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Create an ElasticSearch resource

- We can now create a resource with `kind: ElasticsearchCluster`

- The YAML for that resource will specify all the desired parameters:

  - how many nodes do we want of each type (client, master, data)
  - image to use
  - add-ons (kibana, cerebro, ...)
  - whether to use TLS or not
  - etc.

.exercise[

- Create our ElasticSearch cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-cluster.yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Operator in action

- Over the next minutes, the operator will create:

  - StatefulSets (one for master nodes, one for data nodes)

  - Deployments (for client nodes; and for add-ons like cerebro and kibana)

  - Services (for all these pods)

.exercise[

- Wait for all the StatefulSets to be fully up and running:
  ```bash
  kubectl get statefulsets -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Connecting to our cluster

- Since connecting directly to the ElasticSearch API is a bit raw,
  <br/>we'll connect to the cerebro frontend instead

.exercise[

- Edit the cerebro service to change its type from ClusterIP to NodePort:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch svc cerebro-es -p "spec: { type: NodePort }"
  ```

- Retrieve the NodePort that was allocated:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc cerebro-es
  ```

- Connect to that port with a browser

]

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## (Bonus) Setup filebeat

- Let's send some data to our brand new ElasticSearch cluster!

- We'll deploy a filebeat DaemonSet to collect node logs

.exercise[

- Deploy filebeat:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ~/container.training/k8s/filebeat.yaml
  ```

]

We should see at least one index being created in cerebro.

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## (Bonus) Access log data with kibana

- Let's expose kibana (by making kibana-es a NodePort too)

- Then access kibana

- We'll need to configure kibana indexes

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Deploying our apps with operators

- It is very simple to deploy with `kubectl run` / `kubectl expose`

- We can unlock more features by writing YAML and using `kubectl apply`

- Kustomize or Helm let us deploy in multiple environments

  (and adjust/tweak parameters in each environment)

- We can also use an operator to deploy our application

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Pros and cons of deploying with operators

- The app definition and configuration is persisted in the Kubernetes API

- Multiple instances of the app can be manipulated with `kubectl get`

- We can add labels, annotations to the app instances

- Our controller can execute custom code for any lifecycle event

- However, we need to write this controller

- We need to be careful about changes

  (what happens when the resource `spec` is updated?)

.debug[[k8s/operators.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators.md)]
---

## Operators are not magic

- Look at the ElasticSearch resource definition

  (`~/container.training/k8s/elasticsearch-cluster.yaml`)

- What should happen if we flip the `use-tls` flag? Twice?

- What should happen if we remove / re-add the kibana or cerebro sections?

- What should happen if we change the number of nodes?

- What if we want different images or parameters for the different nodes?

*Operators can be very powerful, iff we know exactly the scenarios that they can handle.*

---
## What does it take to write an operator?

- Writing a quick-and-dirty operator, or a POC/MVP, is easy

- Writing a robust operator is hard

- We will describe the general idea

- We will identify some of the associated challenges

- We will list a few tools that can help us

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Top-down vs. bottom-up

- Both approaches are possible

- Let's see what they entail, and their respective pros and cons

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Top-down approach

- Start with high-level design (see next slide)

- Pros:

  - can yield cleaner design that will be more robust

- Cons:

  - must be able to anticipate all the events that might happen

  - design will be better only to the extend of what we anticipated

  - hard to anticipate if we don't have production experience

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## High-level design

- What are we solving?

  (e.g.: geographic databases backed by PostGIS with Redis caches)

- What are our use-cases, stories?

  (e.g.: adding/resizing caches and read replicas; load balancing queries)

- What kind of outage do we want to address?

  (e.g.: loss of individual node, pod, volume)

- What are our *non-features*, the things we don't want to address?

  (e.g.: loss of datacenter/zone; differentiating between read and write queries;
  <br/>
  cache invalidation; upgrading to newer major versions of Redis, PostGIS, PostgreSQL)

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Low-level design

- What Custom Resource Definitions do we need?

  (one, many?)

- How will we store configuration information?

  (part of the CRD spec fields, annotations, other?)

- Do we need to store state? If so, where?

  - state that is small and doesn't change much can be stored via the Kubernetes API
    <br/>
    (e.g.: leader information, configuration, credentials)

  - things that are big and/or change a lot should go elsewhere
    <br/>
    (e.g.: metrics, bigger configuration file like GeoIP)

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What can we store via the Kubernetes API?

- The API server stores most Kubernetes resources in etcd

- Etcd is designed for reliability, not for performance

- If our storage needs exceed what etcd can offer, we need to use something else:

  - either directly

  - or by extending the API server
    <br/>(for instance by using the agregation layer, like [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server) does)

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Bottom-up approach

- Start with existing Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Stateful Set...)

- Run the system in production

- Add scripts, automation, to facilitate day-to-day operations

- Turn the scripts into an operator

- Pros: simpler to get started; reflects actual use-cases

- Cons: can result in convoluted designs requiring extensive refactor

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## General idea

- Our operator will watch its CRDs *and associated resources*

- Drawing state diagrams and finite state automata helps a lot

- It's OK if some transitions lead to a big catch-all "human intervention"

- Over time, we will learn about new failure modes and add to these diagrams

- It's OK to start with CRD creation / deletion and prevent any modification

  (that's the easy POC/MVP we were talking about)

- *Presentation* and *validation* will help our users

  (more on that later)

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Challenges

- Reacting to infrastructure disruption can seem hard at first

- Kubernetes gives us a lot of primitives to help:

  - Pods and Persistent Volumes will *eventually* recover

  - Stateful Sets give us easy ways to "add N copies" of a thing

- The real challenges come with configuration changes

  (i.e., what to do when our users update our CRDs)

- Keep in mind that [some] of the [largest] cloud [outages] haven't been caused by [natural catastrophes], or even code bugs, but by configuration changes

[some]: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/gcp-outage-mainone-leaked-google-cloudflare-ip-addresses-china-telecom/

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Configuration changes

- It is helpful to analyze and understand how Kubernetes controllers work:

  - watch resource for modifications

  - compare desired state (CRD) and current state

  - issue actions to converge state

- Configuration changes will probably require *another* state diagram or FSA

- Again, it's OK to have transitions labeled as "unsupported"

  (i.e. reject some modifications because we can't execute them)

---

## Validation

- By default, a CRD is "free form"

  (we can put pretty much anything we want in it)

- When creating a CRD, we can provide an OpenAPI v3 schema
  ([Example](https://github.com/amaizfinance/redis-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/k8s_v1alpha1_redis_crd.yaml#L34))

- The API server will then validate resources created/edited with this schema

- If we need a stronger validation, we can use a Validating Admission Webhook:

  - run an [admission webhook server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#write-an-admission-webhook-server) to receive validation requests

  - register the webhook by creating a [ValidatingWebhookConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#configure-admission-webhooks-on-the-fly)

  - each time the API server receives a request matching the configuration,
    <br/>the request is sent to our server for validation

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Presentation

- By default, `kubectl get mycustomresource` won't display much information

  (just the name and age of each resource)

- When creating a CRD, we can specify additional columns to print
  ([Example](https://github.com/amaizfinance/redis-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/k8s_v1alpha1_redis_crd.yaml#L6),
  [Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#additional-printer-columns))

- By default, `kubectl describe mycustomresource` will also be generic

- `kubectl describe` can show events related to our custom resources

  (for that, we need to create Event resources, and fill the `involvedObject` field)

- For scalable resources, we can define a `scale` sub-resource

- This will enable the use of `kubectl scale` and other scaling-related operations

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## About scaling

- It is possible to use the HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) with CRDs

- But it is not always desirable

- The HPA works very well for homogenous, stateless workloads

- For other workloads, your mileage may vary

- Some systems can scale across multiple dimensions

  (for instance: increase number of replicas, or number of shards?)

- If autoscaling is desired, the operator will have to take complex decisions

  (example: Zalando's Elasticsearch Operator ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lprE0J0kAq0)))

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Versioning

- As our operator evolves over time, we may have to change the CRD

  (add, remove, change fields)

- Like every other resource in Kubernetes, [custom resources are versioned](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/
)

- When creating a CRD, we need to specify a *list* of versions

- Versions can be marked as `stored` and/or `served`

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Stored version

- Exactly one version has to be marked as the `stored` version

- As the name implies, it is the one that will be stored in etcd

- Resources in storage are never converted automatically

  (we need to read and re-write them ourselves)

- Yes, this means that we can have different versions in etcd at any time

- Our code needs to handle all the versions that still exist in storage

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Served versions

- By default, the Kubernetes API will serve resources "as-is"

  (using their stored version)

- It will assume that all versions are compatible storage-wise

  (i.e. that the spec and fields are compatible between versions)

- We can provide [conversion webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion) to "translate" requests

  (the alternative is to upgrade all stored resources and stop serving old versions)

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Operator reliability

- Remember that the operator itself must be resilient

  (e.g.: the node running it can fail)

- Our operator must be able to restart and recover gracefully

- Do not store state locally

  (unless we can reconstruct that state when we restart)

- As indicated earlier, we can use the Kubernetes API to store data:

  - in the custom resources themselves

  - in other resources' annotations

.debug[[k8s/operators-design.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/operators-design.md)]
---

## Beyond CRDs

- CRDs cannot use custom storage (e.g. for time series data)

- CRDs cannot support arbitrary subresources (like logs or exec for Pods)

- CRDs cannot support protobuf (for faster, more efficient communication)

- If we need these things, we can use the [aggregation layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) instead

- The aggregation layer proxies all requests below a specific path to another server

  (this is used e.g. by the metrics server)

- [This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#choosing-a-method-for-adding-custom-resources) compares the features of CRDs and API aggregation

# Owners and dependents

- Some objects are created by other objects

  (example: pods created by replica sets, themselves created by deployments)

- When an *owner* object is deleted, its *dependents* are deleted

  (this is the default behavior; it can be changed)

- We can delete a dependent directly if we want

  (but generally, the owner will recreate another right away)

- An object can have multiple owners

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Finding out the owners of an object

- The owners are recorded in the field `ownerReferences` in the `metadata` block

.exercise[

- Let's create a deployment running `nginx`:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment yanginx --image=nginx
  ```

- Scale it to a few replicas:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment yanginx --replicas=3
  ```

- Once it's up, check the corresponding pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -l app=yanginx -o yaml | head -n 25
  ```

]

These pods are owned by a ReplicaSet named yanginx-xxxxxxxxxx.

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Listing objects with their owners

- This is a good opportunity to try the `custom-columns` output!

.exercise[

- Show all pods with their owners:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o custom-columns=\
  NAME:.metadata.name,\
  OWNER-KIND:.metadata.ownerReferences[0].kind,\
  OWNER-NAME:.metadata.ownerReferences[0].name
  ```

]

Note: the `custom-columns` option should be one long option (without spaces),
so the lines should not be indented (otherwise the indentation will insert spaces).

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Deletion policy

- When deleting an object through the API, three policies are available:

  - foreground (API call returns after all dependents are deleted)

  - background (API call returns immediately; dependents are scheduled for deletion)

  - orphan (the dependents are not deleted)

- When deleting an object with `kubectl`, this is selected with `--cascade`:

  - `--cascade=true` deletes all dependent objects (default)

  - `--cascade=false` orphans dependent objects

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## What happens when an object is deleted

- It is removed from the list of owners of its dependents

- If, for one of these dependents, the list of owners becomes empty ...

  - if the policy is "orphan", the object stays

  - otherwise, the object is deleted

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Orphaning pods

- We are going to delete the Deployment and Replica Set that we created

- ... without deleting the corresponding pods!

.exercise[

- Delete the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment -l app=yanginx --cascade=false
  ```

- Delete the Replica Set:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete replicaset -l app=yanginx --cascade=false
  ```

- Check that the pods are still here:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## When and why would we have orphans?

- If we remove an owner and explicitly instruct the API to orphan dependents

  (like on the previous slide)

- If we change the labels on a dependent, so that it's not selected anymore

  (e.g. change the `app: yanginx` in the pods of the previous example)

- If a deployment tool that we're using does these things for us

- If there is a serious problem within API machinery or other components

  (i.e. "this should not happen")

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Finding orphan objects

- We're going to output all pods in JSON format

- Then we will use `jq` to keep only the ones *without* an owner

- And we will display their name

.exercise[

- List all pods that *do not* have an owner:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o json | jq -r "
          .items[]
          | select(.metadata.ownerReferences|not)
          | .metadata.name"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/owners-and-dependents.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/owners-and-dependents.md)]
---

## Deleting orphan pods

- Now that we can list orphan pods, deleting them is easy

.exercise[

- Add `| xargs kubectl delete pod` to the previous command:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod -o json | jq -r "
          .items[]
          | select(.metadata.ownerReferences|not)
          | .metadata.name" | xargs kubectl delete pod
  ```

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## CPU vs memory

- CPU is a *compressible resource*

  (it can be preempted immediately without adverse effect)

- Memory is an *incompressible resource*

  (it needs to be swapped out to be reclaimed; and this is costly)

- As a result, exceeding limits will have different consequences for CPU and memory

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Exceeding CPU limits

- CPU can be reclaimed instantaneously

  (in fact, it is preempted hundreds of times per second, at each context switch)

- If a container uses too much CPU, it can be throttled

  (it will be scheduled less often)

- The processes in that container will run slower

  (or rather: they will not run faster)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Exceeding memory limits

- Memory needs to be swapped out before being reclaimed

- "Swapping" means writing memory pages to disk, which is very slow

- On a classic system, a process that swaps can get 1000x slower

  (because disk I/O is 1000x slower than memory I/O)

- Exceeding the memory limit (even by a small amount) can reduce performance *a lot*

- Kubernetes *does not support swap* (more on that later!)

- Exceeding the memory limit will cause the container to be killed



.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limits vs requests

- Limits are "hard limits" (they can't be exceeded)

  - a container exceeding its memory limit is killed

  - a container exceeding its CPU limit is throttled

- Requests are used for scheduling purposes

  - a container using *less* than what it requested will never be killed or throttled

  - the scheduler uses the requested sizes to determine placement

  - the resources requested by all pods on a node will never exceed the node size

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Pod quality of service

Each pod is assigned a QoS class (visible in `status.qosClass`).

- If limits = requests:

  - as long as the container uses less than the limit, it won't be affected

  - if all containers in a pod have *(limits=requests)*, QoS is considered "Guaranteed"

- If requests &lt; limits:

  - as long as the container uses less than the request, it won't be affected

  - otherwise, it might be killed/evicted if the node gets overloaded

  - if at least one container has *(requests&lt;limits)*, QoS is considered "Burstable"

- If a pod doesn't have any request nor limit, QoS is considered "BestEffort"

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Quality of service impact

- When a node is overloaded, BestEffort pods are killed first

- Then, Burstable pods that exceed their limits

- Burstable and Guaranteed pods below their limits are never killed

  (except if their node fails)

- If we only use Guaranteed pods, no pod should ever be killed

  (as long as they stay within their limits)

(Pod QoS is also explained in [this page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) of the Kubernetes documentation and in [this blog post](https://medium.com/google-cloud/quality-of-service-class-qos-in-kubernetes-bb76a89eb2c6).)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Where is my swap?

- The semantics of memory and swap limits on Linux cgroups are complex

- In particular, it's not possible to disable swap for a cgroup

  (the closest option is to [reduce "swappiness"](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/77939/turning-off-swapping-for-only-one-process-with-cgroups))

- The architects of Kubernetes wanted to ensure that Guaranteed pods never swap

- The only solution was to disable swap entirely

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Alternative point of view

- Swap enables paging¹ of anonymous² memory

- Even when swap is disabled, Linux will still page memory for:

  - executables, libraries

  - mapped files

- Disabling swap *will reduce performance and available resources*

- For a good time, read [kubernetes/kubernetes#53533](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53533)

- Also read this [excellent blog post about swap](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/17/mystery-swap/)

¹Paging: reading/writing memory pages from/to disk to reclaim physical memory

²Anonymous memory: memory that is not backed by files or blocks

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Enabling swap anyway

- If you don't care that pods are swapping, you can enable swap

- You will need to add the flag `--fail-swap-on=false` to kubelet

  (otherwise, it won't start!)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Specifying resources

- Resource requests are expressed at the *container* level

- CPU is expressed in "virtual CPUs"

  (corresponding to the virtual CPUs offered by some cloud providers)

- CPU can be expressed with a decimal value, or even a "milli" suffix

  (so 100m = 0.1)

- Memory is expressed in bytes

- Memory can be expressed with k, M, G, T, ki, Mi, Gi, Ti suffixes

  (corresponding to 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12, 2^10, 2^20, 2^30, 2^40)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Specifying resources in practice

This is what the spec of a Pod with resources will look like:

```yaml
containers:
- name: httpenv
  image: jpetazzo/httpenv
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: "100Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
    requests:
      memory: "100Mi"
      cpu: "10m"
```

This set of resources makes sure that this service won't be killed (as long as it stays below 100 MB of RAM), but allows its CPU usage to be throttled if necessary.

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Default values

- If we specify a limit without a request: 

  the request is set to the limit

- If we specify a request without a limit: 

  there will be no limit

  (which means that the limit will be the size of the node)

- If we don't specify anything:

  the request is zero and the limit is the size of the node

*Unless there are default values defined for our namespace!*

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## We need default resource values

- If we do not set resource values at all:

  - the limit is "the size of the node"

  - the request is zero

- This is generally *not* what we want

  - a container without a limit can use up all the resources of a node

  - if the request is zero, the scheduler can't make a smart placement decision

- To address this, we can set default values for resources

- This is done with a LimitRange object

# Defining min, max, and default resources

- We can create LimitRange objects to indicate any combination of:

  - min and/or max resources allowed per pod

  - default resource *limits*

  - default resource *requests*

  - maximal burst ratio (*limit/request*)

- LimitRange objects are namespaced

- They apply to their namespace only

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## LimitRange example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: my-very-detailed-limitrange
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    min:
      cpu: "100m"
    max:
      cpu: "2000m"
      memory: "1Gi"
    default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "250Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "500m"
```

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Example explanation

The YAML on the previous slide shows an example LimitRange object specifying very detailed limits on CPU usage,
and providing defaults on RAM usage.

Note the `type: Container` line: in the future,
it might also be possible to specify limits
per Pod, but it's not [officially documented yet](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/9585).

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## LimitRange details

- LimitRange restrictions are enforced only when a Pod is created

  (they don't apply retroactively)

- They don't prevent creation of e.g. an invalid Deployment or DaemonSet

  (but the pods will not be created as long as the LimitRange is in effect)

- If there are multiple LimitRange restrictions, they all apply together

  (which means that it's possible to specify conflicting LimitRanges,
  <br/>preventing any Pod from being created)

- If a LimitRange specifies a `max` for a resource but no `default`,
  <br/>that `max` value becomes the `default` limit too

# Namespace quotas

- We can also set quotas per namespace

- Quotas apply to the total usage in a namespace

  (e.g. total CPU limits of all pods in a given namespace)

- Quotas can apply to resource limits and/or requests

  (like the CPU and memory limits that we saw earlier)

- Quotas can also apply to other resources:

  - "extended" resources (like GPUs)

  - storage size

  - number of objects (number of pods, services...)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Creating a quota for a namespace

- Quotas are enforced by creating a ResourceQuota object

- ResourceQuota objects are namespaced, and apply to their namespace only

- We can have multiple ResourceQuota objects in the same namespace

- The most restrictive values are used

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limiting total CPU/memory usage

- The following YAML specifies an upper bound for *limits* and *requests*:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: a-little-bit-of-compute
    spec:
      hard:
        requests.cpu: "10"
        requests.memory: 10Gi
        limits.cpu: "20"
        limits.memory: 20Gi
  ```

These quotas will apply to the namespace where the ResourceQuota is created.

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Limiting number of objects

- The following YAML specifies how many objects of specific types can be created:
  ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: quota-for-objects
    spec:
      hard:
        pods: 100
        services: 10
        secrets: 10
        configmaps: 10
        persistentvolumeclaims: 20
        services.nodeports: 0
        services.loadbalancers: 0
        count/roles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io: 10
  ```

(The `count/` syntax allows limiting arbitrary objects, including CRDs.)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## YAML vs CLI

- Quotas can be created with a YAML definition

- ...Or with the `kubectl create quota` command

- Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl create quota my-resource-quota --hard=pods=300,limits.memory=300Gi
  ```

- With both YAML and CLI form, the values are always under the `hard` section

  (there is no `soft` quota)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Viewing current usage

When a ResourceQuota is created, we can see how much of it is used:

```
kubectl describe resourcequota my-resource-quota

Name:                            my-resource-quota
Namespace:                       default
Resource                         Used  Hard
--------                         ----  ----
pods                             12    100
services                         1     5
services.loadbalancers           0     0
services.nodeports               0     0
```

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Advanced quotas and PriorityClass

- Since Kubernetes 1.12, it is possible to create PriorityClass objects

- Pods can be assigned a PriorityClass

- Quotas can be linked to a PriorityClass

- This allows us to reserve resources for pods within a namespace

- For more details, check [this documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#resource-quota-per-priorityclass)

# Limiting resources in practice

- We have at least three mechanisms:

  - requests and limits per Pod

  - LimitRange per namespace

  - ResourceQuota per namespace

- Let's see a simple recommendation to get started with resource limits

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Set a LimitRange

- In each namespace, create a LimitRange object

- Set a small default CPU request and CPU limit

  (e.g. "100m")

- Set a default memory request and limit depending on your most common workload

  - for Java, Ruby: start with "1G"

  - for Go, Python, PHP, Node: start with "250M"

- Set upper bounds slightly below your expected node size

  (80-90% of your node size, with at least a 500M memory buffer)

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Set a ResourceQuota

- In each namespace, create a ResourceQuota object

- Set generous CPU and memory limits

  (e.g. half the cluster size if the cluster hosts multiple apps)

- Set generous objects limits

  - these limits should not be here to constrain your users

  - they should catch a runaway process creating many resources

  - example: a custom controller creating many pods

.debug[[k8s/resource-limits.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/resource-limits.md)]
---

## Observe, refine, iterate

- Observe the resource usage of your pods

  (we will see how in the next chapter)

- Adjust individual pod limits

- If you see trends: adjust the LimitRange

  (rather than adjusting every individual set of pod limits)

- Observe the resource usage of your namespaces

  (with `kubectl describe resourcequota ...`)

- Rinse and repeat regularly

# Checking pod and node resource usage

- Since Kubernetes 1.8, metrics are collected by the [resource metrics pipeline](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/)

- The resource metrics pipeline is:

  - optional (Kubernetes can function without it)

  - necessary for some features (like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

  - exposed through the Kubernetes API using the [aggregation layer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/)

  - usually implemented by the "metrics server"

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## How to know if the metrics server is running?

- The easiest way to know is to run `kubectl top`

.exercise[

- Check if the core metrics pipeline is available:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  ```

]

If it shows our nodes and their CPU and memory load, we're good!

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## Installing metrics server

- The metrics server doesn't have any particular requirements

  (it doesn't need persistence, as it doesn't *store* metrics)

- It has its own repository, [kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server)

- The repository comes with [YAML files for deployment](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/tree/master/deploy/1.8%2B)

- These files may not work on some clusters

  (e.g. if your node names are not in DNS)

- The container.training repository has a [metrics-server.yaml](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/blob/master/k8s/metrics-server.yaml#L90) file to help with that

  (we can `kubectl apply -f` that file if needed)

.debug[[k8s/metrics-server.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/metrics-server.md)]
---

## Showing container resource usage

- Once the metrics server is running, we can check container resource usage

.exercise[

- Show resource usage across all containers:
  ```bash
  kubectl top pods --containers --all-namespaces
  ```
]

- We can also use selectors (`-l app=...`)

# Cluster sizing

- What happens when the cluster gets full?

- How can we scale up the cluster?

- Can we do it automatically?

- What are other methods to address capacity planning?

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## When are we out of resources?

- kubelet monitors node resources:

  - memory

  - node disk usage (typically the root filesystem of the node)

  - image disk usage (where container images and RW layers are stored)

- For each resource, we can provide two thresholds:

  - a hard threshold (if it's met, it provokes immediate action)

  - a soft threshold (provokes action only after a grace period)

- Resource thresholds and grace periods are configurable

  (by passing kubelet command-line flags)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What happens then?

- If disk usage is too high:

  - kubelet will try to remove terminated pods

  - then, it will try to *evict* pods

- If memory usage is too high:

  - it will try to evict pods

- The node is marked as "under pressure"

- This temporarily prevents new pods from being scheduled on the node

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Which pods get evicted?

- kubelet looks at the pods' QoS and PriorityClass

- First, pods with BestEffort QoS are considered

- Then, pods with Burstable QoS exceeding their *requests*

  (but only if the exceeding resource is the one that is low on the node)

- Finally, pods with Guaranteed QoS, and Burstable pods within their requests

- Within each group, pods are sorted by PriorityClass

- If there are pods with the same PriorityClass, they are sorted by usage excess

  (i.e. the pods whose usage exceeds their requests the most are evicted first)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Eviction of Guaranteed pods

- *Normally*, pods with Guaranteed QoS should not be evicted

- A chunk of resources is reserved for node processes (like kubelet)

- It is expected that these processes won't use more than this reservation

- If they do use more resources anyway, all bets are off!

- If this happens, kubelet must evict Guaranteed pods to preserve node stability

  (or Burstable pods that are still within their requested usage)

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What happens to evicted pods?

- The pod is terminated

- It is marked as `Failed` at the API level

- If the pod was created by a controller, the controller will recreate it

- The pod will be recreated on another node, *if there are resources available!*

- For more details about the eviction process, see:

  - [this documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/) about resource pressure and pod eviction,

  - [this other documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/) about pod priority and preemption.

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## What if there are no resources available?

- Sometimes, a pod cannot be scheduled anywhere:

  - all the nodes are under pressure,

  - or the pod requests more resources than are available

- The pod then remains in `Pending` state until the situation improves

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]
---

## Cluster scaling

- One way to improve the situation is to add new nodes

- This can be done automatically with the [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)

- The autoscaler will automatically scale up:

  - if there are pods that failed to be scheduled

- The autoscaler will automatically scale down:

  - if nodes have a low utilization for an extended period of time

## Restrictions, gotchas ...

- The Cluster Autoscaler only supports a few cloud infrastructures

  (see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider) for a list)

- The Cluster Autoscaler cannot scale down nodes that have pods using:

  - local storage

  - affinity/anti-affinity rules preventing them from being rescheduled

  - a restrictive PodDisruptionBudget

.debug[[k8s/cluster-sizing.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/cluster-sizing.md)]

## Other way to do capacity planning

- "Running Kubernetes without nodes"

- Systems like [Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/) or Kiyot can run pods using on-demand resources

  - Virtual Kubelet can leverage e.g. ACI or Fargate to run pods

  - Kiyot runs pods in ad-hoc EC2 instances (1 instance per pod)

- Economic advantage (no wasted capacity)

- Security advantage (stronger isolation between pods)

Check [this blog post](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2019/02/13/running-kubernetes-without-nodes-with-kiyot/) for more details.

# The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

- What is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, or HPA?

- It is a controller that can perform *horizontal* scaling automatically

- Horizontal scaling = changing the number of replicas

  (adding/removing pods)

- Vertical scaling = changing the size of individual replicas

  (increasing/reducing CPU and RAM per pod)

- Cluster scaling = changing the size of the cluster

  (adding/removing nodes)

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Principle of operation

- Each HPA resource (or "policy") specifies:

  - which object to monitor and scale (e.g. a Deployment, ReplicaSet...)

  - min/max scaling ranges (the max is a safety limit!)

  - a target resource usage (e.g. the default is CPU=80%)

- The HPA continuously monitors the CPU usage for the related object

- It computes how many pods should be running:

  `TargetNumOfPods = ceil(sum(CurrentPodsCPUUtilization) / Target)`

- It scales the related object up/down to this target number of pods

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Pre-requirements

- The metrics server needs to be running

  (i.e. we need to be able to see pod metrics with `kubectl top pods`)

- The pods that we want to autoscale need to have resource requests

  (because the target CPU% is not absolute, but relative to the request)

- The latter actually makes a lot of sense:

  - if a Pod doesn't have a CPU request, it might be using 10% of CPU...

  - ...but only because there is no CPU time available!

  - this makes sure that we won't add pods to nodes that are already resource-starved

## Testing the HPA

- We will start a CPU-intensive web service

- We will send some traffic to that service

- We will create an HPA policy

- The HPA will automatically scale up the service for us

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## A CPU-intensive web service

- Let's use `jpetazzo/busyhttp`

  (it is a web server that will use 1s of CPU for each HTTP request)

.exercise[

- Deploy the web server:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment busyhttp --image=jpetazzo/busyhttp
  ```

- Expose it with a ClusterIP service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment busyhttp --port=80
  ```

- Get the ClusterIP allocated to the service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc busyhttp
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Monitor what's going on

- Let's start a bunch of commands to watch what is happening

.exercise[

- Monitor pod CPU usage:
  ```bash
  watch kubectl top pods
  ```

- Monitor service latency:
  ```bash
  httping http://`ClusterIP`/
  ```

- Monitor cluster events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events -w
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Send traffic to the service

- We will use `ab` (Apache Bench) to send traffic

.exercise[

- Send a lot of requests to the service, with a concurrency level of 3:
  ```bash
  ab -c 3 -n 100000 http://`ClusterIP`/
  ```

]

The latency (reported by `httping`) should increase above 3s.

The CPU utilization should increase to 100%.

(The server is single-threaded and won't go above 100%.)

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Create an HPA policy

- There is a helper command to do that for us: `kubectl autoscale`

.exercise[

- Create the HPA policy for the `busyhttp` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl autoscale deployment busyhttp --max=10
  ```

]

By default, it will assume a target of 80% CPU usage.

This can also be set with `--cpu-percent=`.

*The autoscaler doesn't seem to work. Why?*

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## What did we miss?

- The events stream gives us a hint, but to be honest, it's not very clear:

  `missing request for cpu`

- We forgot to specify a resource request for our Deployment!

- The HPA target is not an absolute CPU%

- It is relative to the CPU requested by the pod

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## Adding a CPU request

- Let's edit the deployment and add a CPU request

- Since our server can use up to 1 core, let's request 1 core

.exercise[

- Edit the Deployment definition:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit deployment busyhttp
  ```

- In the `containers` list, add the following block:
  ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "1"
  ```

]

## Results

- After saving and quitting, a rolling update happens

  (if `ab` or `httping` exits, make sure to restart it)

- It will take a minute or two for the HPA to kick in:

  - the HPA runs every 30 seconds by default

  - it needs to gather metrics from the metrics server first

- If we scale further up (or down), the HPA will react after a few minutes:

  - it won't scale up if it already scaled in the last 3 minutes

  - it won't scale down if it already scaled in the last 5 minutes

.debug[[k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training.git/tree/nr-2019-08/slides/k8s/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.md)]
---

## What about other metrics?

- The HPA in API group `autoscaling/v1` only supports CPU scaling

- The HPA in API group `autoscaling/v2beta2` supports metrics from various API groups:

  - metrics.k8s.io, aka metrics server (per-Pod CPU and RAM)

  - custom.metrics.k8s.io, custom metrics per Pod

  - external.metrics.k8s.io, external metrics (not associated to Pods)

- Kubernetes doesn't implement any of these API groups

- Using these metrics requires [registering additional APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-metrics-apis)

- The metrics provided by metrics server are standard; everything else is custom

- For more details, see [this great blog post](https://medium.com/uptime-99/kubernetes-hpa-autoscaling-with-custom-and-external-metrics-da7f41ff7846) or [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSiGFH4ZnS8)
